= Active Job

Sometimes a specific piece of code takes a long time to run but
doesn't need to run right away. An example is sending an e-mail
after creating an order at the end of a online shopping workflow. It
can take a couple of seconds to send an e-mail but you don't want
your user to wait for that to happen within the controller.
It makes more sense to use a queueing mechanism for these tasks.

Active Job provides such a queueing system. You can create jobs which
are being processed asynchronous by active job.

== Create a New Job

The quickest way to create a new job is the job generator. Lets create
an example job which waits for 10 seconds and than logs an info message:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new shop
  [...]
$ cd shop
$ rails generate job example
Running via Spring preloader in process 98344
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/jobs/example_job_test.rb
      create  app/jobs/example_job.rb
$
----

All jobs are created in the `app/jobs` directory. Please change the
`app/jobs/example_job.rb` file accordingly:

[source,ruby]
.app/jobs/example_job.rb
----
class ExampleJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(*args)
    sleep 10
    logger.info "Just waited 10 seconds."
  end
end
----

You can test the job in your console with `ExampleJob.perform_later`
which creates it:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 98485
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> ExampleJob.perform_later
Enqueued ExampleJob (Job ID: bb6e9781-8ffb-4bf2-8dfc-8ac983ed8bf6)
to Async(default)
=> #<ExampleJob:0x007f816d466680 @arguments=[],
@job_id="bb6e9781-8ffb-4bf2-8dfc-8ac983ed8bf6", @queue_name="default",
@priority=nil, @executions=0,
@provider_job_id="263a31ae-b33d-4a12-a603-22dfbba9cab7">
>> Performing ExampleJob (Job ID: bb6e9781-8ffb-4bf2-8dfc-8ac983ed8bf6)
from Async(default)
Just waited 10 seconds.
Performed ExampleJob (Job ID: bb6e9781-8ffb-4bf2-8dfc-8ac983ed8bf6)
from Async(default) in 10012.97ms

?> exit
----

The file `log/development.log` now contains the logging output.

A more concrete example of using jobs you'll find in the
xref:action-mailer[Action Mailer chapter] where an e-mail gets send.

== Set the time for future execution

The `set` method provides two arguments which can be used to set
the execution of a job in the future:

* wait
+
[source,ruby]
----
ExampleJob.set(wait: 1.hour).perform_later
----
+
* wait_until
+
[source,ruby]
----
ExampleJob.set(wait_until: Date.tomorrow.noon).perform_later
----
+

== Configure the Job Server Backend

The page http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveJob/QueueAdapters.html
lists all available backends. To use one of them you have to install
the needed gem. Here is an example for the use of the popular
https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq[Sidekiq]. To use the gem you have to
add it to `Gemfile` and run a `bundle install` afterwards:

[source,ruby]
.Gemfile
----
[...]
gem 'sidekiq'
----

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle install
----

In `config/application.rb` you can configure
the use of it:

[source,ruby]
.config/application.rb
----
require_relative 'boot'

require 'rails/all'

# Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems
# you've limited to :test, :development, or :production.
Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module Shop
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # Initialize configuration defaults for originally generated Rails version.
    config.load_defaults 5.1

    # Settings in config/environments/* take precedence over those specified here.
    # Application configuration should go into files in config/initializers
    # -- all .rb files in that directory are automatically loaded.

    # Sidekiq Configuration
    config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq
  end
end
