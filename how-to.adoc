[[how-to]]
= How to work with this book

This book requires basic knowledge of HTML, plus the reader - you, in
other words - should also have a basic understanding of programming. I'm not
going to teach you what a variable is. I'm just using them. I work
a lot with example code and not so much with abstract definitions.

NOTE: It's a technical book. Therefore there are parts which are mindblowing
      boring. But I try to keep it to a minium.

Each chapter and most sections work autarkic. You don't have to read the
book in the order and you can skip chapters if they are not important to you.
All code examples work without any dependecies to earlier chapters. I'm not
going to build a gigantic application to show how cool Rails is. I prefer
the approach of small projects to analyse and discuss specific topics.
