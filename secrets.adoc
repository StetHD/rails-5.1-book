= Secrets

Deploying secret API keys or other secret configuration to a production
environment can become quite a hassle. You normally don't want to commit them
unencrypted to your repository. And you also want to share them with other
developers.

Rails 5.1 introduces a solution for this. You still have to store one central
encryption key on your server and on all development systems, but that's it.
All other secrets are encrypted with that key and can be stored safely in
your code repository.

We start with a new rails application:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new shop
$ cd shop
----

== Setup

A fresh Rails application doesn't provide a secret store. It has to be generated
with the command `rails secrets:setup`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails secrets:setup
Adding config/secrets.yml.key to store the encryption key: 413f24df7b871e4947c774aab68553e0

Save this in a password manager your team can access.

If you lose the key, no one, including you, can access any encrypted secrets.

      create  config/secrets.yml.key

Ignoring config/secrets.yml.key so it won't end up in Git history:

      append  .gitignore

Adding config/secrets.yml.enc to store secrets that needs to be encrypted.

      create  config/secrets.yml.enc

For now the file contains this but it's been encrypted with the generated key:

# See `secrets.yml` for tips on generating suitable keys.
# production:
#  external_api_key: 1466aac22e6a869134be3d09b9e89232fc2c2289â€¦

You can edit encrypted secrets with `bin/rails secrets:edit`.
Add this to your config/environments/production.rb:
config.read_encrypted_secrets = true
$
----

In this example the secret key is `413f24df7b871e4947c774aab68553e0`. It is
very important to keep this key securely. Anyone who has it can decrypt
your secrets and if you lose it you can not decrypt your secrets any more.

The key is stored in the file `config/secrets.yml.key` and this file was added
to the `.gitignore` file so that you don't accidentally upload it to your
git repository.

The file `config/secrets.yml.enc` contains the encrypted secrets.

[source,bash]
----
$ cat config/secrets.yml.enc

## Activating the Secrets

You're Rails application has the keys but can not use it until you set
`config.read_encrypted_secrets = true` in the configuration of your environment.
By default this is already the case in the production environment:

[source,ruby]
.config/environments/production.rb
----
[...]
# Attempt to read encrypted secrets from `config/secrets.yml.enc`.
# Requires an encryption key in `ENV["RAILS_MASTER_KEY"]` or
# `config/secrets.yml.key`.
config.read_encrypted_secrets = true
[...]
----

You have to add this configuration to the `config/environments/development.rb`
file if you want to have access to it in the development environment too.

## Editing the Secrets

Because `config/secrets.yml.enc` is encrypted you can't edit it directly. You
can to do it via `rails secrets:edit`. In case you are using the `bash` shell
and don't have the env variable `EDITOR` already set you can edit your secrets
with this command:

[source,bash]
----
$ EDITOR=vim rails secrets:edit
----

Secrets are saved in the YAML format.

## Secrets for different environments

You can create secrets for any environment and you can share them too. Here is
an example:

[source,yaml]
----
shared:
  abc: "I am shared"
production:
  zzz: "I am in production"
----

## Accessing a key

You can access a secret with the format
`AppName::Application.secrets.name_of_the_secret`. Here is an example for the
above configuration:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console production
Running via Spring preloader in process 19662
Loading production environment (Rails 5.1.0)
>> Shop::Application.secrets.abc
=> "I am shared"
>> Shop::Application.secrets.zzz
=> "I am in production"
>> exit
----

## Using the secrets on the production web server

To use the secrets in the production web server system you have to either
copy the file `config/secrets.yml.key` with the secret key to that system or
set the environment variable `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` with it.
