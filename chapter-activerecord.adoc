[[activerecord]]
= ActiveRecord

`ActiveRecord` is a level of abstraction that offers access to a SQL
database. `ActiveRecord` implements the architectural pattern _Active
Record_.

NOTE: This is referred to as object-relational-mapping or _ORM_.
      I find it rather dry and boring, but in case you have trouble
      going to sleep tonight, have a look at
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapping.

One of the recipes for the success of Rails is surely the fact that is
uses `ActiveRecord`. The programming and use "feels Ruby like" and it is
much less susceptible to errors than pure SQL. When working with this
chapter, it helps if you have some knowledge of SQL, but this is not
required and also not essential for working with `ActiveRecord`.

This chapter is only about ActiveRecord. So I am not going to integrate
any tests to keep the examples as simple as possible.

[[creating-databasemodel]]
== Creating Database/Model

Model in this context refers to the data model of Model-View-Controller
(MVC).

As a first example, let's take a list of countries in Europe. First, we
create a new Rails project:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new europe
  [...]
$ cd europe
----

Next, let's have a look at the help page for `rails generate model`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model
Running via Spring preloader in process 21883
Usage:
  rails generate model NAME [field[:type][:index] field[:type][:index]] [options]

[...]

Description:
    Stubs out a new model. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

[...]

Available field types:

    Just after the field name you can specify a type like text or boolean.
    It will generate the column with the associated SQL type. For instance:

        `rails generate model post title:string body:text`

    will generate a title column with a varchar type and a body column with a text
    type. If no type is specified the string type will be used by default.
    You can use the following types:

        integer
        primary_key
        decimal
        float
        boolean
        binary
        string
        text
        date
        time
        datetime
[...]
----

The usage description
`rails generate model NAME [field[:type][:index] field[:type][:index]] [options]`
tells us that after `rails generate model` comes the name of the model
and then the table fields. If you do not put `:type` after a table field
name, it is assumed to be a `string`.

Let's create the _model_ `country`:

[source,bash]
----
$ **rails generate model Country name population:integer**
Running via Spring preloader in process 22053
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20170322165321_create_countries.rb
      create    app/models/country.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/country_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/countries.yml
----

The generator has created a database migration file with the name
`db/migrate/20170322165321_create_countries.rb`. It provides the
following code:

[source,ruby]
.db/migrate/20170322165321_create_countries.rb
----
class CreateCountries < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :countries do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.integer :population

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
----

A migration contains database changes. In this migration, a class
`CreateCountries` is defined as a child of `ActiveRecord::Migration`. The
method `change` is used to define a migration and the associated
roll-back.

With the command `rails db:migrate` we can apply the migrations, in other
words, create the corresponding database table:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:migrate
== 20170322165321 CreateCountries: migrating ==================================
-- create_table(:countries)
   -> 0.0010s
== 20170322165321 CreateCountries: migrated (0.0011s) =========================
----

NOTE: You will find more details on migrations in
      xref:migrations[the section "Migrations"].

Let's have a look at the file `app/models/country.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/country.rb
----
class Country < ApplicationRecord
end
----

Hmmm ... the class `Country` is a child of `ApplicationRecord` which
inherits from `ApplicationRecord`. Makes sense, as we are discussing
ActiveRecord in this chapter. ;-)

[[the-attributes-id-created_at-and-updated_at]]
=== The Attributes `id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`

Even if you cannot see it in the migration, we also get the attributes
`id`, `created_at` und `updated_at` by default for each ActiveRecord
model. In the Rails console, we can output the attributes of the class
`Country` by using the class method `column_names`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 22303
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Country.column_names
=> ["id", "name", "population", "created_at", "updated_at"]
>> exit
----

The attribute `created_at` stores the time when the record was initially
created. `updated_at` stores the time of the last update for this
record.

`id` is used a central identification of the record (primary key). The
`id` is automatically incremented by 1 for each new record.

[[getters-and-setters]]
=== Getters and Setters

To read and write values of a SQL table row you can use by ActiveRecord
provided xref:getters-and-setters[getters and setters].
These `attr_accessors` are automatically
created. The getter of the field `updated_at` for a given `Country` with
the name `germany` would be `germany.updated_at`.

[[possible-data-types-in-activerecord]]
=== Possible Data Types in ActiveRecord

ActiveRecord is a _layer_ between Ruby and various relational databases.
Unfortunately, many SQL databases have different perspectives regarding
the definition of columns and their content. But you do not need to
worry about this, because ActiveRecord solves this problem transparently
for you.

To generate a _model_, you can use the following field types:

.Field Types
|===
|Name | Description

|`binary`
| This is a BLOB (_Binary Large Object_) in the classical sense. Never
  heard of it? Then you probably won't need it.
  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object

| `boolean`
| true, false or nil

| `date`
| You can store a date here.

| `datetime`
| Here you can store a date including a time.

| `integer`
| For storing an integer.
  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)

| `decimal`
| For storing a decimal number.

| `primary_key`
| This is an integer that is automatically incremented by 1 by the
  database for each new entry. This field type is often used as key for
  linking different database tables or _models_.
  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_key

| `string`
| A string, in other words a sequence of any characters, up to a maximum
  of 2^8 -1 (= 255) characters.
  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)

| `text`
|  Also a string - but considerably bigger. By default, up to 2^16 -1 (=
   65535)  characters can be saved here.

| `time`
| A time.

| `timestamp`
| A time with date, filled in automatically by the database.

|===

[[decimal]]
=== Decimal

You can also define a `decimal` with the model generator. But you
need to observe the special syntax (you have to use `'` if you are using the Bash shell).

Example for creating a price with a decimal:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model product name 'price:decimal{7,2}'
  [...]
$
----

That would generate this migration:

[source,ruby]
.db/migrate/20170322170623_create_products.rb
----
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.decimal :price, precision: 7, scale: 2

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
----

In xref:#migrations["Migrations"] we will provide more
information on the individual data types and discuss available options.

[[naming-conventions-country-vs.-country-vs.-countries]]
=== Naming Conventions (`Country` vs. `country` vs. `countries`)

ActiveRecord automatically uses the English plural forms. So for the
class `Country`, it's `countries`. If you are not sure about a term, you can
also work with the `class` and `method` name.

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 23132
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Country.name.tableize
=> "countries"
>> Country.name.foreign_key
=> "country_id"
>> exit
----

[[database-configuration]]
=== Database Configuration

Which database is used by default? Let's have a quick look at the
configuration file for the database (`config/database.yml`):

[source,yaml]
.config/database.yml
----
# SQLite version 3.x
#   gem install sqlite3
#
#   Ensure the SQLite 3 gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem 'sqlite3'
#
default: &default
  adapter: sqlite3
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  timeout: 5000

development:
  <<: *default
  database: db/development.sqlite3

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: db/test.sqlite3

production:
  <<: *default
  database: db/production.sqlite3
----

As we are working in `development` mode, Rails has created a new SQLite3
database `db/development.sqlite3` as a result of `rails db:migrate` and
will save all data there.

Fans of command line clients can use `sqlite3` for viewing this
database:

[source,bash]
----
$ sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3
SQLite version 3.14.0 2016-07-26 15:17:14
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables
ar_internal_metadata  countries             schema_migrations
sqlite> .schema countries
CREATE TABLE "countries" ("id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
"name" varchar, "population" integer, "created_at" datetime NOT NULL,
"updated_at" datetime NOT NULL);
sqlite> .exit
----

[[adding-records]]
== Adding Records

Actually, I would like to show you first how to view records, but to show
records you have to create them first. So first, here is how you can
create a new record with `ActiveRecord`.

[[create]]
=== `create`

The most frequently used method for creating a new record is `create`.

Let's try creating a country in the console with the command
`Country.create(name: 'Germany', population: 81831000)`

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 23285
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Country.create(name: 'Germany', population: 81831000)
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.4ms)  INSERT INTO "countries" ("name", "population", "created_at",
  "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Germany"],
  ["population", 81831000], ["created_at", "2017-03-22 17:10:30.859482"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-22 17:10:30.859482"]]
   (2.2ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Country id: 1, name: "Germany", population: 81831000,
created_at: "2017-03-22 17:10:30", updated_at: "2017-03-22 17:10:30">
>> exit
----

ActiveRecord saves the new record and outputs the executed SQL command
in the development environment. But to make absolutely sure it works,
let's have a last look with the command line client `sqlite3`:

[source,bash]
----
$ sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3
SQLite version 3.14.0 2016-07-26 15:17:14
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM countries;
1|Germany|81831000|2017-03-22 17:10:30.859482|2017-03-22 17:10:30.859482
sqlite> .exit
----

[[syntax]]
==== Syntax

The method `create` can handle a number of different syntax constructs.
If you want to create a single record, you can do this with or without
{}-brackets within the the ()-brackets:

* `Country.create(name: 'Germany', population: 81831000)`
* `Country.create({name: 'Germany', population: 81831000})`

Similarly, you can describe the attributes differently:

* `Country.create(:name => 'Germany', :population => 81831000)`
* `Country.create('name' => 'Germany', 'population' => 81831000)`
* `Country.create( name: 'Germany', population: 81831000)`

You can also pass an array of hashes to create and use this approach to
create several records at once:

[source,ruby]
----
Country.create([{name: 'Germany'}, {name: 'France'}])
----

[[new]]
=== `new`

In addition to `create` there is also `new`. But you have to use the `save`
method to save an object created with `new` (which has both advantages and
disadvantages):

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 23679
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> france = Country.new
=> #<Country id: nil, name: nil, population: nil, created_at: nil,
updated_at: nil>
>> france.name = 'France'
=> "France"
>> france.population = 65447374
=> 65447374
>> france.save
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "countries" ("name", "population", "created_at",
  "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "France"],
  ["population", 65447374], ["created_at", "2017-03-22 17:15:30.001686"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-22 17:15:30.001686"]]
   (2.1ms)  commit transaction
=> true
>> france
=> #<Country id: 2, name: "France", population: 65447374,
created_at: "2017-03-22 17:15:30", updated_at: "2017-03-22 17:15:30">
----

You can also pass parameters for the new record directly to the method
`new`, just as with `create`:

[source,bash]
----
>> belgium = Country.new(name: 'Belgium', population: 10839905)
=> #<Country id: nil, name: "Belgium", population: 10839905,
created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> belgium.save
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "countries" ("name", "population",
  "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Belgium"],
  ["population", 10839905], ["created_at", "2017-03-22 17:16:31.091853"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-22 17:16:31.091853"]]
   (2.5ms)  commit transaction
=> true
>> exit
----

[[new_record]]
=== `new_record?`

With the method `new_record?` you can find out if a record has already
been saved or not. If a `new` object has been created with new and not
yet been saved, then the result of `new_record?` is `true`. After a
`save` it's `false`.

Example:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 23823
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> netherlands = Country.new(name: 'Netherlands')
=> #<Country id: nil, name: "Netherlands", population: nil,
created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> netherlands.new_record?
=> true
>> netherlands.save
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "countries" ("name", "created_at",
  "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Netherlands"],
  ["created_at", "2017-03-22 17:17:34.694389"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-22 17:17:34.694389"]]
   (2.1ms)  commit transaction
=> true
>> netherlands.new_record?
=> false
>> exit
----

TIP: For already existing records, you can also check for changes with
     the method `changed?` (see xref:changed["changed?"]).
     You can even use `netherland.population_changed?` to check if just
     the attribute `popluation` was changed.

[[first-last-and-all]]
== first, last and all

In certain cases, you may need the first record, or the last one, or
perhaps even all records. Conveniently, there is a ready-made method for
each case. Let's start with the easiest ones: `first` and `last`.

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 24090
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Country.first
  Country Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "countries".* FROM "countries" ORDER BY
  "countries"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Country id: 1, name: "Germany", population: 81831000, created_at:
"2017-03-22 17:10:30", updated_at: "2017-03-22 17:10:30">
>> Country.last
  Country Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "countries".* FROM "countries" ORDER BY
  "countries"."id" DESC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Country id: 4, name: "Netherlands", population: nil, created_at:
"2017-03-22 17:17:34", updated_at: "2017-03-22 17:17:34">
----

And now all at once with `all`:

[source,bash]
----
>> Country.all
  Country Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "countries".* FROM "countries"
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Country id: 1, name: "Germany",
population: 81831000, created_at: "2017-03-22 17:10:30",
updated_at: "2017-03-22 17:10:30">, #<Country id: 2, name: "France",
population: 65447374, created_at: "2017-03-22 17:15:30",
updated_at: "2017-03-22 17:15:30">, #<Country id: 3, name: "Belgium",
population: 10839905, created_at: "2017-03-22 17:16:31",
updated_at: "2017-03-22 17:16:31">, #<Country id: 4, name: "Netherlands",
population: nil, created_at: "2017-03-22 17:17:34",
updated_at: "2017-03-22 17:17:34">]>
----

But the objects created by `first`, `last` and `all` are different.

[source,bash]
----
>> Country.first.class
  Country Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "countries".* FROM "countries"
  ORDER BY "countries"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> Country(id: integer, name: string, population: integer,
created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime)
>> Country.all.class
=> Country::ActiveRecord_Relation
----

So `Country.first` is a `Country` which makes sense. But `Country.all` is
something we haven't had yet. Let's use the console to get a better idea
of it:

[source,bash]
----
>> puts Country.all.to_yaml
  Country Load (0.4ms)  SELECT "countries".* FROM "countries"
---
- !ruby/object:Country
  concise_attributes:
  - !ruby/object:ActiveRecord::Attribute::FromDatabase
    name: id
    value_before_type_cast: 1
  - !ruby/object:ActiveRecord::Attribute::FromDatabase
    name: name
    value_before_type_cast: Germany
  - !ruby/object:ActiveRecord::Attribute::FromDatabase
    name: population
    value_before_type_cast: 81831000
  - !ruby/object:ActiveRecord::Attribute::FromDatabase
    name: created_at
    value_before_type_cast: '2017-03-22 17:10:30.859482'
  - !ruby/object:ActiveRecord::Attribute::FromDatabase
    name: updated_at
    value_before_type_cast: '2017-03-22 17:10:30.859482'
  new_record: false
  active_record_yaml_version: 2
[...]
=> nil
----

hmmm... by using the `to_yaml` method suddenly the database has work to
do. The reason for this behavior is optimization. Let's assume that you
want to chain a couple of methods. Than it might be better for
ActiveRecord to wait till the very last second which it does. It only
requests the data from the SQL database when it has to do it (it's
called xref:lazy-loading[Lazy Loading]). Until than it stores the request in a
`ActiveRecord::Relation`.

The result of `Country.all` is actually an `Array` of `Country`.

If `Country.all` returns an array, then we should also be able to use
xref:iterators[iterators] and xref:iterator-each[each], right?
Yes, of course! That is the beauty of it. Here is a little experiment
with `each`:

[source,bash]
----
>> Country.all.each do |country|
?> puts country.name
>> end
  Country Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "countries".* FROM "countries"
Germany
France
Belgium
Netherlands
=> [#<Country id: 1, name: "Germany", [...]]
----

So can we also use `.all.first` as an alternative for `.first`? Yes, but
it does not make much sense. Have a look for yourself:

[source,bash]
----
>> Country.first
  Country Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "countries".* FROM "countries"
  ORDER BY "countries"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Country id: 1, name: "Germany", population: 81831000,
created_at: "2017-03-22 17:10:30", updated_at: "2017-03-22 17:10:30">
>> Country.all.first
  Country Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "countries".* FROM "countries"
  ORDER BY "countries"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Country id: 1, name: "Germany", population: 81831000,
created_at: "2017-03-22 17:10:30", updated_at: "2017-03-22 17:10:30">
>> exit
----

`Country.first` and `Country.all.first` result in exact the same SQL
query because ActiveRecord optimizes it.

NOTE: ActiveRecord does not only provide the `first`
      method but also `second`, `third`, `fourth` and `fifth`.
      It's obvious what they do.

[[populating-the-database-with-seeds.rb]]
== Populating the Database with seeds.rb

With the file `db/seeds.rb`, the Rails gods have given us a way of
feeding default values easily and quickly to a fresh installation. This
is a normal Ruby program within the Rails environment. You have full
access to all classes and methods of your application.

With that you don't need to enter everything manually with `rails console` to xref:create[create] all initial records in a new Rails application.
You can use the file `db/seeds.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.db/seeds.rb
----
Country.create(name: 'Germany', population: 81831000)
Country.create(name: 'France', population: 65447374)
Country.create(name: 'Belgium', population: 10839905)
Country.create(name: 'Netherlands', population: 16680000)
----

You then populate it with data via `rails db:seed`.

If you want to delete the existing database, recreate it and than
populate it with the seeds you can use `rails db:reset`. That's
what we do here:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:reset
Dropped database 'db/development.sqlite3'
Dropped database 'db/test.sqlite3'
Created database 'db/development.sqlite3'
Created database 'db/test.sqlite3'
-- create_table("countries", {:force=>:cascade})
   -> 0.0050s
-- create_table("countries", {:force=>:cascade})
   -> 0.0032s
----

I use the file `db/seeds.rb` at this point because it offers a simple
mechanism for filling an empty database with useful values. In the
course of this book, this will make it easier for us to set up quick
example scenarios.

[[its-all-just-ruby-code]]
=== It's all just Ruby code

The `db/seeds.rb` is a Ruby program. Correspondingly, we can also use
the following approach as an alternative:

[source,ruby]
.db/seeds.rb
----
country_list = [
  [ "Germany", 81831000 ],
  [ "France", 65447374 ],
  [ "Belgium", 10839905 ],
  [ "Netherlands", 16680000 ]
]

country_list.each do |name, population|
  Country.create( name: name, population: population )
end
----

The result is the same. I am showing you this example to make it clear
that you can program normally within `db/seeds.rb`.

[[generating-seeds.rb-from-existing-data]]
=== Generating `seeds.rb` From Existing Data

Sometimes it can be useful to export the current data pool of a Rails
application into a `db/seeds.rb`. While writing this book, I encountered
this problem in almost every chapter. Unfortunately, there is no
standard approach for this. I am showing you what you can do in this
case. There are other, more complex scenarios that can be derived from
my approach.

We create our own little rake task for that. A rake task is a Ruby
programm which is stored in the `lib/tasks/` directory and which has
full access to the Rails environment.

[source,ruby]
.lib/tasks/export.rake
----
namespace :export do
  desc "Prints Country.all in a seeds.rb way."
  task :seeds_format => :environment do
    Country.order(:id).all.each do |country|
      bad_keys = ['created_at', 'updated_at', 'id']
      serialized = country.serializable_hash.
                   delete_if{|key,value| bad_keys.include?(key)}
      puts "Country.create(#{serialized})"
    end
  end
end
----

Then you can call the corresponding rake task with the command
`rails export:seeds_format`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails export:seeds_format
Country.create({"name"=>"Germany", "population"=>81831000})
Country.create({"name"=>"France", "population"=>65447374})
Country.create({"name"=>"Belgium", "population"=>10839905})
Country.create({"name"=>"Netherlands", "population"=>16680000})
----

You can either expand this program so that the output is written
directly into the `db/seeds.rb` or you can simply use the shell:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails export:seeds_format > db/seeds.rb

[[searching-and-finding-with-queries]]
== Searching and Finding with Queries

The methods `first` and `all` are already quite nice, but usually you
want to search for something more specific with a query.

For describing queries, we create a new Rails project:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new jukebox
  [...]
$ cd jukebox
$ rails generate model Album name release_year:integer
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
----

For the examples uses here, use a `db/seeds.rb` with the following
content:

[source,ruby]
.db/seeds.rb
----
Album.create(name: "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", release_year: 1967)
Album.create(name: "Pet Sounds", release_year: 1966)
Album.create(name: "Revolver", release_year: 1966)
Album.create(name: "Highway 61 Revisited", release_year: 1965)
Album.create(name: "Rubber Soul", release_year: 1965)
Album.create(name: "What's Going On", release_year: 1971)
Album.create(name: "Exile on Main St.", release_year: 1972)
Album.create(name: "London Calling", release_year: 1979)
Album.create(name: "Blonde on Blonde", release_year: 1966)
Album.create(name: "The Beatles", release_year: 1968)
----

Then, set up the new database with `rails db:reset`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:reset
Dropped database 'db/development.sqlite3'
Database 'db/test.sqlite3' does not exist
Created database 'db/development.sqlite3'
Created database 'db/test.sqlite3'
-- create_table("albums", {:force=>:cascade})
   -> 0.0189s
-- create_table("albums", {:force=>:cascade})
   -> 0.0045s
----

[[find]]
=== find

The simplest case is searching for a record via a primary key (by
default, the `id` field in the database table). If I know the ID of an
object, then I can search for the individual object or several objects
at once via the ID:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 26956
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Album.find(2)
  Album Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums"
  WHERE "albums"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 2], ["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Album id: 2, name: "Pet Sounds", release_year: 1966,
created_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06", updated_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06">
>> Album.find([1,3,7])
  Album Load (0.4ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums"
  WHERE "albums"."id" IN (1, 3, 7)
=> [#<Album id: 1, name: "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band",
release_year: 1967, created_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06",
updated_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06">, #<Album id: 3, name: "Revolver",
release_year: 1966, created_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06",
updated_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06">, #<Album id: 7,
name: "Exile on Main St.", release_year: 1972,
created_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06", updated_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06">]
----

If you always want to have an array as result, you also always have to
pass an array as parameter:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.find(5).class
  Album Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums"
  WHERE "albums"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 5], ["LIMIT", 1]]
=> Album(id: integer, name: string, release_year: integer,
created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime)
>> Album.find([5]).class
  Album Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums"
  WHERE "albums"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 5], ["LIMIT", 1]]
=> Array
>> exit
----

WARNING: The method `find` generates an exception if the ID you are
         searching for does not have a record in the database.

[[where]]
=== where

With the method `where`, you can search for specific values in the
database. Let's search for all `albums` from the year 1966:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27119
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Album.where(release_year: 1966)
  Album Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums"
  WHERE "albums"."release_year" = ?  [["release_year", 1966]]
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 2, name: "Pet Sounds",
release_year: 1966, created_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06",
updated_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06">, #<Album id: 3,
name: "Revolver", release_year: 1966,
created_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06", updated_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06">,
#<Album id: 9, name: "Blonde on Blonde", release_year: 1966,
created_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06", updated_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06">]>
>> Album.where(release_year: 1966).count
   (0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums"
   WHERE "albums"."release_year" = ?  [["release_year", 1966]]
=> 3
----

You can also use `where` to search for xref:range[ranges]:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(release_year: 1960..1966).count
   (0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums"
   WHERE ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN ? AND ?)
   [["release_year", 1960], ["release_year", 1966]]
=> 5
----

And you can also specify several search factors simultaneously,
separated by commas:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(release_year: 1960..1966, id: 1..5).count
   (0.4ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums"
   WHERE ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN ? AND ?)
   AND ("albums"."id" BETWEEN ? AND ?)  [["release_year", 1960],
   ["release_year", 1966], ["id", 1], ["id", 5]]
=> 4
----

Or an array of parameters:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(release_year: [1966, 1968]).count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums"
   WHERE "albums"."release_year" IN (1966, 1968)
=> 4
----

The result of `where` is always an array. Even if it only contains one
hit or if no hit is returned (which will result in an empty array).
If you are looking for the first hit, you need to combine the method
`where` with the method `first`:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(release_year: [1966, 1968]).first
  Album Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums"
  WHERE "albums"."release_year" IN (1966, 1968)
  ORDER BY "albums"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Album id: 2, name: "Pet Sounds", release_year: 1966,
created_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06", updated_at: "2017-03-22 18:19:06">
>> exit
----

[[not]]
==== not

The method `not` provides a way to search for the exact oposite of a
`where` query. Example:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27349
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Album.where.not(release_year: 1968).count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums"
   WHERE ("albums"."release_year" != ?)  [["release_year", 1968]]
=> 9
>> exit

----

[[or]]
==== or

The method `or` provides a way to combine queries with a
logical `or`. Example:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27449
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Album.where(release_year: 1967).or(Album.where(name: 'The Beatles')).count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums"
   WHERE ("albums"."release_year" = ? OR "albums"."name" = ?)
   [["release_year", 1967], ["name", "The Beatles"]]
=> 2
>> exit
----

[[sql-queries-with-where]]
==== SQL Queries with where

Sometimes there is no other way and you just have to define and execute
your own SQL query. In ActiveRecord, there are two different ways of
doing this. One _sanitizes_ each query before executing it and the other
passes the query on to the SQL database 1 to 1 as it is. Normally, you
should always use the sanitized version because otherwise you can easily
fall victim to an _SQL injection_ attack (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sql_injection).

NOTE: If you do not know much about SQL, you can safely skip this
      section. The SQL commands used here are not explained further.

[[sanitized-queries]]
===== Sanitized Queries

In this variant, all dynamic search parts are replaced by a question
mark as placeholder and only listed as parameters after the SQL string.

In this example, we are searching for all `albums` whose `name`
contains the string “on”:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27553
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Album.where( 'name like ?', '%on%').count
   (0.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums" WHERE (name like '%on%')
=> 5
----

Now the number of albums that were published from 1965 onwards:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where( 'release_year > ?', 1964 ).count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums" WHERE (release_year > 1964)
=> 10
----

The number of albums that are more recent than 1970 and whose name
contains the string “on”:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where( 'name like ? AND release_year > ?', '%on%', 1970 ).count
   (0.4ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums" WHERE (name like '%on%'
   AND release_year > 1970)
=> 3
----

If the variable `search_string` contains the desired string, you can
search for it as follows:

[source,bash]
----
>> search_string = 'ing'
=> "ing"
>> Album.where( 'name like ?', "%#{search_string}%").count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums" WHERE (name like '%ing%')
=> 2
>> exit
----

[[dangerous-sql-queries]]
==== Dangerous SQL Queries

If you really know what you are doing, you can of course also define the
SQL query completely and forego the _sanitizing_ of the query.

Let's count all albums whose name contain the string “on”:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27699
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Album.where( "name like '%on%'" ).count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums" WHERE (name like '%on%')
=> 5
>> exit
----

Please only use this variation if you know exactly what you are doing
and once you have familiarized yourself with the topic SQL injections
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sql_injection).

[[lazy-loading]]
==== Lazy Loading

Lazy Loading is a mechanism that only carries out a database query if
the program flow cannot be realised without the result of this query.
Until then, the query is saved as `ActiveRecord::Relation`.

NOTE: Incidentally, the opposite of _lazy loading_ is referred to
      as _eagerloading_.

Does it make sense in principle, but you aren't sure what the point of
it all is? Then let's cobble together a query where we nest several
methods. In the following example, `a` is defined more and more closely
and only at the end (when calling the method `all`) the database query
would really be executed in a production system. With the method
ActiveRecord methods `to_sql` you can display the current SQL query.

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27764
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> a = Album.where(release_year: 1965..1968)
  Album Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE
  ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1965 AND 1968)
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 1, [...]]>
>> a.class
=> Album::ActiveRecord_Relation
>> a = a.order(:release_year)
  Album Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE
  ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1965 AND 1968)  ORDER BY
  "albums"."release_year" ASC
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 4, [...]]>
>> a = a.limit(3)
  Album Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE
  ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1965 AND 1968)  ORDER BY
  "albums"."release_year" ASC LIMIT 3
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 4, [...]]>
>> exit
----

The console can be a bit tricky about this. It tries to help the
developer by actually showing the result but in a non-console
environment this would would only happen at the very last time.

[[automatic-optimization]]
==== Automatic Optimization

One of the great advantages of _lazy loading_ is the automatic
optimization of the SQL query through ActiveRecord.

Let's take the sum of all release years of the albums that came out in
the 70s. Then we sort the albums alphabetically and then calculate the
sum.

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27764
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Album.where(release_year: 1970..1979).sum(:release_year)
   (1.5ms)  SELECT SUM("albums"."release_year") FROM "albums" WHERE
   ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979)
=> 5922
>> Album.where(release_year: 1970..1979).order(:name).sum(:release_year)
   (0.3ms)  SELECT SUM("albums"."release_year") FROM "albums" WHERE
   ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979)
=> 5922
>> exit
----

Logically, the result is the same for both queries. But the interesting
thing is that ActiveRecord uses the same SQL code for both queries. It
has detected that `order` is completely irrelevant for `sum` and
therefore took it out altogether.

NOTE: In case you are asking yourself why the first query took 1.5ms
      and the second 0.3ms: ActiveRecord cached the results of the
      first SQL request.

[[order-and-reverse_order]]
=== `order` and `reverse_order`

To sort a database query, you can use the method `order`.

Example: all albums from the 60s, sorted by name:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27764
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> **Album.where(release_year: 1960..1969).order(:name)**
  Album Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE
  ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969)  ORDER BY "albums"."name"
  ASC
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 9, name: "Blonde on Blonde" [...]]>
----

With the method `reverse_order` you can reverse an order previously
defined via `order`:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(release_year: 1960..1969).order(:name).reverse_order
  Album Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE
  ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969)  ORDER BY "albums"."name"
  DESC
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 10, name: "The Beatles" [...]]>
----

[[limit]]
=== limit

The result of any search can be limited to a certain range via the
method `limit`.

The first 5 albums from the 60s:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(release_year: 1960..1969).limit(5)
  Album Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE
  ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969) LIMIT 5
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 1, [...]]>
----

All albums sorted by name, then the first 5 of those:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.order(:name).limit(5)
  Album Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums"  ORDER BY
  "albums"."name" ASC LIMIT 5
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 9, name: "Blonde [...]]>
----

[[offset]]
==== offset

With the method `offset`, you can define the starting position of the
method limit.

First, we return the first two records and then the first two records
with an offset of 5:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.limit(2)
  Album Load (1.0ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums" LIMIT 2
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 1, [...]>, #<Album id: 2, [...]]>
>> Album.limit(2).offset(5)
  Album Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums" LIMIT 2 OFFSET 5
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 6, [...]>, #<Album id: 7, [...]>]>
----

[[group]]
=== group

With the method `group`, you can return the result of a query in grouped
form.

Let's return all `albums`, grouped by their `release_year`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27764
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Album.group(:release_year)
  Album Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" GROUP BY "albums"."release_year"
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 5, name: "Rubber Soul", release_year:
1965, created_at: "2015-12-16 17:45:34", updated_at: "2015-12-16 17:45:34">,
#<Album id: 9, name: "Blonde on Blonde", release_year: 1966, created_at:

17:45:34">, #<Album id: 7, name: "Exile on Main St.", release_year: 1972,

17:45:34", updated_at: "2015-12-16 17:45:34">]>
>> exit
----

[[pluck]]
=== pluck

Normally, ActiveRecord pulls all table columns from the database and
leaves it up to the programmer to later pick out the components he is
interested in. But in case of large amounts of data, it can be useful
and above all much quicker to define a specific database field directly
for the query. You can do this via the method `pluck`.

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Album.where(release_year: 1960..1969).pluck(:name)
   (0.2ms)  SELECT "albums"."name" FROM "albums"
   WHERE ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN ? AND ?)
   [["release_year", 1960], ["release_year", 1969]]
=> ["Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "Pet Sounds", "Revolver",
"Highway 61 Revisited", "Rubber Soul", "Blonde on Blonde", "The Beatles"]
----

As a result, `pluck` returns an array. You can pluck more than one
fields too:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(release_year: 1960..1969).pluck(:name, :release_year)
   (0.3ms)  SELECT "albums"."name", "albums"."release_year"
   FROM "albums" WHERE ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN ? AND ?)
   [["release_year", 1960], ["release_year", 1969]]
=> [["Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", 1967],
["Pet Sounds", 1966], ["Revolver", 1966], ["Highway 61 Revisited", 1965],
["Rubber Soul", 1965], ["Blonde on Blonde", 1966], ["The Beatles", 1968]]
----

[[select]]
=== select

`select` works like `pluck` but returns an ActiveRecord::Relation.

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(release_year: 1960..1969).select(:name)
  Album Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "albums"."name" FROM "albums"
  WHERE ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969)
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: nil,
name: "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band">,
#<Album id: nil, name: "Pet Sounds">,
#<Album id: nil, name: "Revolver">,
#<Album id: nil, name: "Highway 61 Revisited">,
#<Album id: nil, name: "Rubber Soul">,
#<Album id: nil, name: "Blonde on Blonde">,
#<Album id: nil, name: "The Beatles">]>
----

[[first_or_create-and-first_or_initialize]]
=== first_or_create and first_or_initialize

The methods `first_or_create` and `first_or_initialize` are ways
to search for a specific entry in your database or create one if the
entry doesn't exist already. Both have to be chained to a `where`
search.

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(name: 'Test')
  Album Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums"
  WHERE "albums"."name" = ?  [["name", "Test"]]
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation []>
>> test = Album.where(name: 'Test').first_or_create
  Album Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums"
  WHERE "albums"."name" = ?  ORDER BY "albums"."id" ASC LIMIT 1
  [["name", "Test"]]
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.4ms)  INSERT INTO "albums" ("name", "created_at", "updated_at")
  VALUES (?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Test"],

  ["updated_at", "2015-12-16 18:34:35.775645"]]
   (9.2ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Album id: 11, name: "Test", release_year: nil,

[[calculations]]
== Calculations

[[average]]
=== average

With the method `average`, you can calculate the average of the values
in a particular column of the table. Our data material is of course not
really suited to this. But as an example, let's calculate the average
release year of all albums and then the same for albums from the 60s:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.average(:release_year)
   (0.3ms)  SELECT AVG("albums"."release_year") FROM "albums"
=> #<BigDecimal:7fd76fd027a0,'0.19685E4',18(36)>
>> Album.average(:release_year).to_s
   (0.2ms)  SELECT AVG("albums"."release_year") FROM "albums"
=> "1968.5"
>> Album.where( :release_year => 1960..1969 ).average(:release_year)
   (0.1ms)  SELECT AVG("albums"."release_year") FROM "albums" WHERE
   ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969)
=> #<BigDecimal:7fd76fc908d0,'0.1966142857 14286E4',27(36)>
>> Album.where( :release_year => 1960..1969 ).average(:release_year).to_s
   (0.3ms)  SELECT AVG("albums"."release_year") FROM "albums" WHERE
   ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969)
=> "1966.14285714286"
----

[[count]]
=== count

The name says it all: the method `count` counts the number of records.

First, we return the number of all albums in the database and then the
number of albums from the 60s:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.count
   (0.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums"
=> 11
----

[[maximum]]
=== maximum

With the method `maximum`, you can output the item with the highest
value within a query.

Let's look for the highest release year:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.maximum(:release_year)
   (0.2ms)  SELECT MAX("albums"."release_year") FROM "albums"
=> 1979
----

[[minimum]]
=== minimum

With the method `minimum`, you can output the item with the lowest value
within a query.

Let's find the lowest release year:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.minimum(:release_year)
   (0.2ms)  SELECT MIN("albums"."release_year") FROM "albums"
=> 1965
----

[[sum]]
=== sum

With the method `sum`, you can calculate the sum of all items in a
specific column of the database query.

Let's find the sum of all release years:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.sum(:release_year)
   (0.2ms)  SELECT SUM("albums"."release_year") FROM "albums"
=> 19685
----

[[sql-explain]]
== SQL EXPLAIN

Most SQL databases can provide detailed information on a SQL query with
the command `EXPLAIN`. This does not make much sense for our mini
application, but if you are working with a large database one day, then
`EXPLAIN` is a good debugging method, for example to find out where to
place an index. SQL EXPLAIN can be called with the method `explain` (it
will be displayed in prettier form if you add a `puts`):

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(release_year: 1960..1969)
  Album Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE
  ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969)
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Album id: 1, [...]>]>
>> Album.where(release_year: 1960..1969).explain
  Album Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE
  ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969)
=> EXPLAIN for: SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE ("albums"."release_year"
BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969)
0|0|0|SCAN TABLE albums
----

[[batches]]
== Batches

ActiveRecord stores the results of a query in Memory. With very large
tables and results that can become a performance issue. To address this
you can use the `find_each` method which splits up the query into
batches with the default size of 1,000 (can be configured with the
`:batch_size` option). Our example `Album` table is too small to show
the effect but the method would be used like this:

[source,bash]
----
>> Album.where(release_year: 1960..1969).find_each do |album|
?>   puts album.name.upcase
>> end
  Album Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE
  ("albums"."release_year" BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969)  ORDER BY "albums"."id" ASC
  LIMIT 1000
SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND
PET SOUNDS
REVOLVER
HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED
RUBBER SOUL
BLONDE ON BLONDE
THE BEATLES
=> nil

[[editing-a-record]]
== Editing a Record

Adding and searching data is quite nice, but often you want to edit a
record. To show how that's done I use the `album` database from the
xref:searching-and-finding-with-queries[section "Searching and Finding
with Queries"].

[[simple-editing]]
=== Simple Editing

Simple editing of a record takes place with the following steps:

* Finding the record and creating a corresponding instance
* Changing the attribute
* Saving the record via the method ActiveRecord methods `save`

We are now searching for the album “The Beatles” and changing it's name
to “A Test”:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> beatles_album = Album.where(name: 'The Beatles').first
  Album Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums"
  WHERE "albums"."name" = ?  ORDER BY "albums"."id" ASC LIMIT 1
  [["name", "The Beatles"]]
=> #<Album id: 10, name: "The Beatles", release_year: 1968,
created_at: "2015-12-16 17:45:34", updated_at: "2015-12-16 17:45:34">
>> beatles_album.name
=> "The Beatles"
>> beatles_album.name = 'A Test'
=> "A Test"
>> beatles_album.save
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.6ms)  UPDATE "albums" SET "name" = ?, "updated_at" = ?
  WHERE "albums"."id" = ?  [["name", "A Test"],
  ["updated_at", "2015-12-16 18:46:03.851575"], ["id", 10]]

[[active-model-dirty]]
=== Active Model Dirty

http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Dirty.html[ActiveModel::Dirty] provides simple mechanisms to track changes of an ActiveRecord Model.

[[changed]]
==== changed?

If you are not sure if a record has been changed and not yet saved, you
can check via the method `changed?`:

[source,bash]
----
>> beatles_album = Album.where(id: 10).first
  Album Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE "albums"."id" = ?
  ORDER BY "albums"."id" ASC LIMIT 1  [["id", 10]]
=> #<Album id: 10, name: "A Test", release_year: 1968, created_at: "2015-12-16
17:45:34", updated_at: "2015-12-16 18:46:03">
>> beatles_album.changed?
=> false
>> beatles_album.name = 'The Beatles'
=> "The Beatles"
>> beatles_album.changed?
=> true
>> beatles_album.save
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction SQL (0.6ms)  UPDATE "albums" SET "name" = ?,
   "updated_at" = ? WHERE "albums"."id" = ?  [["name", "The Beatles"],
   ["updated_at", "2015-12-16 18:47:26.794527"], ["id", 10]] (9.2ms)  commit
   transaction
=> true
>> beatles_album.changed?
=> false
----

==== _changed?

An attribute name followed by `_changed?` tracks changes to a specific attribute.

[source,bash]
----
>> beatles_album = Album.where(id: 10).first
  Album Load (0.5ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE "albums"."id" = ? ORDER BY "albums"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["id", 10], ["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Album id: 10, name: "The Beatles", release_year: 1968, created_at: "2016-01-21 10:15:51", updated_at: "2016-01-21 10:15:51">
>> beatles_album.release_year_changed?
=> false
>> beatles_album.release_year = 1900
=> 1900
>> beatles_album.release_year_changed?
=> true
----

[[update]]
=== update

With the method `update` you can change several attributes of
an object in one go and then immediately save them automatically.

Let's use this method within the example used in
xref:simple-editing[the section "Simple Editing"]:

[source,bash]
----
>> first_album = Album.first
  Album Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  "albums".* FROM "albums" ORDER BY "albums"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Album id: 1, name: "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", release_year: 1967, created_at: "2016-01-21 10:15:51", updated_at: "2016-01-21 10:15:51">
>> first_album.changed?
=> false
>> first_album.update(name: 'Another Test')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.4ms)  UPDATE "albums" SET "name" = ?, "updated_at" = ? WHERE "albums"."id" = ?  [["name", "Another Test"], ["updated_at", 2016-01-21 12:11:27 UTC], ["id", 1]]
   (0.9ms)  commit transaction
=> true
>> first_album.changed?
=> false
>> first_album
=> #<Album id: 1, name: "Another Test", release_year: 1967, created_at: "2016-01-21 10:15:51", updated_at: "2016-01-21 12:11:27">
----

[[locking]]
=== Locking

There are many ways of locking a database. By default, Rails uses
“optimistic locking” of records. To activate locking a model needs to
have an attribute with the name `lock_version` which has to be an
integer. To show how it works I'll create a new Rails project with
a `Product` model. Then I'll try to change the price of the first
`Product` on two different instances. The second change will raise
an `ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError`.

Example setup:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new shop
  [...]
$ cd shop
$ rails generate model Product name 'price:decimal{8,2}'
  lock_version:integer
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
$
----

Raising an `ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console

----

You have to deal with the conflict by rescuing the exception and fix the
conflict depending on your business logic.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to add a `lock_version` hidden field in
           your forms when using this mechanism with a WebGUI.

[[has_many-1n-association]]
== has_many – 1:n Association

In order to explain `has_many`, let's create a food store application.
We create a `Category` and a `Product` model. A `Product` belongs to
a `Category`. It's a 1:n association (_one-to-many association_).

NOTE: Associations are also sometimes referred to as _relations_ or
      _relationships_.

First, we create a Rails application:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new food_store
  [...]
$ cd food_store
----

Now we create the model for the categories:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model Category name
  [...]
$
----

And finally, we create the database table for the `Product`. In this, we
need an assignment field to the category table. This _foreign key_ is
always set by default as name of the referenced object (here: `category`)
with an attached `_id`. We could run the command
`rails generate model product name price:integer category_id:integer` but
there is a better way of doing it:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model product name price:integer category:references
Running via Spring preloader in process 35988
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20170323074157_create_products.rb
      create    app/models/product.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/product_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/products.yml
----

Why is it better? Because it creates a different kind of migration
which includes a foreign key optimization:

[source,ruby]
.db/migrate/20170323074157_create_products.rb
----
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.integer :price
      t.references :category, foreign_key: true

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
----

Then execute a `rails db:migrate` so that the database tables are
actually created:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:migrate
----

Let's have a look at this on the console:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 36245
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Category.column_names
=> ["id", "name", "created_at", "updated_at"]
>> Product.column_names
=> ["id", "name", "price", "category_id", "created_at", "updated_at"]
>> exit
----

The two database tables are set up and can be used with ActiveRecord.
And because we used `category:references` it automatically inserted the
belongs to relationship into the `Product` model:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :category
end
----

But we have to add the "has many" part manually in the `Category` model:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/category.rb
----
class Category < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :products
end
----

That's all we need to do to tell ActiveRecord about the 1:n relation.
These two simple definitions form the basis for a good deal of
ActiveRecord magic. It will generate a bunch of cool new methods for us
to link both models.

[[creating-records]]
=== Creating Records

In this example, we want to save a record for the product "Apple"
which belongs to the category "Fruits". Fire up your console and
follow my lead.

[[create-1]]
==== create

First create a new category for the fruits:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 37142
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> fruits = Category.create(name: "Fruits")
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "categories"
  ("name", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?)
  [["name", "Fruits"], ["created_at", "2017-03-23 07:55:13.482884"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-23 07:55:13.482884"]]
   (2.3ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Category id: 1, name: "Fruits",
created_at: "2017-03-23 07:55:13",
updated_at: "2017-03-23 07:55:13">
----

Because the `Category` model has a `has_many :products` definition
is provides a `products` method which we can use to get all products
of a given category:

[source,bash]
----
>> fruits.products
  Product Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "products".* FROM "products" WHERE "products"."category_id" = ?  [["category_id", 1]]
=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy []>
----

Of course this is empty right now. But it is getting better. We can
chain a `create` method after `fruits.products` to create a new
product which has the needed `category_id`:

[source,bash]
----
>> fruits.products
  Product Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "products".* FROM "products"
  WHERE "products"."category_id" = ?  [["category_id", 1]]
=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy []>
----

But it gets even better. We can chain the `create` method after the
`fruits.products` to actually create a new product which has the
correct `category_id`:

[source,bash]
----
>> apple = fruits.products.create(name: "Apple", price: 1)
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.4ms)  INSERT INTO "products"
  ("name", "price", "category_id", "created_at", "updated_at")
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Apple"], ["price", 1],
  ["category_id", 1], ["created_at", "2017-03-23 08:00:39.595699"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-23 08:00:39.595699"]]
   (3.4ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Product id: 1, name: "Apple", price: 1, category_id: 1,
created_at: "2017-03-23 08:00:39", updated_at: "2017-03-23 08:00:39">
----

Of course this can be done manually too:

[source,bash]
----
>> pineapple = Product.create(name: "Pineapple", price: 2, category_id: 1)
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  Category Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "categories".* FROM "categories"
  WHERE "categories"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 1], ["LIMIT", 1]]
  SQL (0.4ms)  INSERT INTO "products"
  ("name", "price", "category_id", "created_at", "updated_at")
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Pineapple"], ["price", 2],
  ["category_id", 1], ["created_at", "2017-03-23 08:04:16.382548"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-23 08:04:16.382548"]]
   (2.5ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Product id: 2, name: "Pineapple", price: 2, category_id: 1,
created_at: "2017-03-23 08:04:16", updated_at: "2017-03-23 08:04:16">
----

If you don't want to chain `create` after `fruits.products` you can
also create a new `Product` and fill in the `category_id` like this:

[source,bash]
----
>> orange = Product.create(name: "Orange", price: 1, category: fruits)
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (1.3ms)  INSERT INTO "products"
  ("name", "price", "category_id", "created_at", "updated_at")
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Orange"], ["price", 1],
  ["category_id", 1], ["created_at", "2017-03-23 08:15:37.575534"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-23 08:15:37.575534"]]
   (2.4ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Product id: 3, name: "Orange", price: 1, category_id: 1,
created_at: "2017-03-23 08:15:37", updated_at: "2017-03-23 08:15:37">
----

I think the chained version is the best but who am I to judge.

Now we have three products which belong to fruits:

[source,bash]
----
>> fruits.products.count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "products"
   WHERE "products"."category_id" = ?  [["category_id", 1]]
=> 3
>> exit
----

[[build]]
==== build

The method `build` resembles `create`. But the record is not saved. This
only happens after a `save`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 40092
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> fruits = Category.where(name: "Fruits").first
  Category Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  "categories".* FROM "categories"
  WHERE "categories"."name" = ? ORDER BY "categories"."id" ASC LIMIT ?
  [["name", "Fruits"], ["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Category id: 1, name: "Fruits", created_at: "2017-03-23 07:55:13",
updated_at: "2017-03-23 07:55:13">
>> cherry = fruits.products.build(name: "Cherry", price: 1)
=> #<Product id: nil, name: "Cherry", price: 1, category_id: 1,
created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> cherry.save
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (1.9ms)  INSERT INTO "products" ("name", "price", "category_id",
  "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Cherry"],
  ["price", 1], ["category_id", 1],
  ["created_at", "2017-03-23 08:22:48.044002"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-23 08:22:48.044002"]]
   (2.6ms)  commit transaction
=> true
>> exit
----

[WARNING]
====
When using `create` and `build`, you of course have to observe
logical dependencies, otherwise there will be an error.
For example, you cannot chain two `build` methods. Example:

[source,bash]
----
>> Category.build(name: "Vegetable").products.build(name: "Potato")
NoMethodError: undefined method `build' for #<Class:0x007f8d7c72c020>

[[accessing-records]]
=== Accessing Records

First we need example data. Please populate the file `db/seeds.rb` with
the following content:

[source,ruby]
.db/seeds.rb
----
fruits = Category.create(name: "Fruits")
vegetables = Category.create(name: "Vegetables")
jams = Category.create(name: "Jams")

fruits.products.create(name: "Apple", price: 1)
fruits.products.create(name: "Banana", price: 2)
fruits.products.create(name: "Pineapple", price: 3)
fruits.products.create(name: "Raspberry", price: 1)
fruits.products.create(name: "Strawberry", price: 1)

vegetables.products.create(name: "Potato", price: 2)
vegetables.products.create(name: "Carrot", price: 1)
vegetables.products.create(name: "Broccoli", price: 2)
vegetables.products.create(name: "Cauliflower", price: 1)

jams.products.create(name: "Strawberry", price: 1)
jams.products.create(name: "Raspberry", price: 1)
----

Now drop the database and refill it with the `db/seeds.rb`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:reset
----

We already know how to access the products of a given category:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 45107
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Category.first.products.count
  Category Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  "categories".* FROM "categories"
  ORDER BY "categories"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
   (0.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "products"
   WHERE "products"."category_id" = ?  [["category_id", 1]]
=> 5
----

You can access the records simply via the plural form of the n model.
Hmmmm, maybe it also works the other way round? Let's try the singluar
of the 1 model:

[source,bash]
----
>> Product.first.category
  Product Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "products".* FROM "products"
  ORDER BY "products"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
  Category Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "categories".* FROM "categories"
  WHERE "categories"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 1], ["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Category id: 1, name: "Fruits", created_at: "2017-03-23 14:23:16",
updated_at: "2017-03-23 14:23:16">
>> exit
----

Bingo! Accessing the associated `Category` class is also very easy. And as
it's only a single record (`belongs_to`), the singular form is used in
this case.

NOTE: If there was no product for a category, the result would be an empty
      array. If no category is associated with an product, then ActiveRecord
      outputs the value `nil` as `Category`.

[[searching-for-records]]

=> 11
----

And how many categories?

[source,bash]
----
>> Category.count
   (0.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "categories"
=> 3
----

[[joins]]
==== joins

To find all categories that have at least one product with the name
"Strawberry" we use a `join`.

[source,bash]
----
>> Category.joins(:products).where(:products => {name: "Strawberry"})
  Category Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "categories".* FROM "categories"
  INNER JOIN "products" ON "products"."category_id" = "categories"."id"
  WHERE "products"."name" = ?  [["name", "Strawberry"]]
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Category id: 1, name: "Fruits",
created_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:14", updated_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:14">,
#<Category id: 3, name: "Jams", created_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:14",
updated_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:14">]>
>>
----

The database contains two categories with a product 'Strawberry'.
In the SQL, you can see that the method `joins` executes an `INNER JOIN`.

Of course, we can also do it the other way round. We could search for
the products with the category "Jams":

[source,bash]
----
>> Product.joins(:category).where(:categories => {name: "Jams"})
  Product Load (0.4ms)  SELECT "products".* FROM "products"
  INNER JOIN "categories" ON "categories"."id" = "products"."category_id"
  WHERE "categories"."name" = ?  [["name", "Jams"]]
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Product id: 10, name: "Strawberry",
price: 1, category_id: 3, created_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:15",
updated_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:15">, #<Product id: 11, name: "Raspberry",
price: 1, category_id: 3, created_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:15",
updated_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:15">]>
----

[[includes]]
==== includes

`includes` is very similar to the method `joins` (see xref:joins[joins]).
Again, you can use it to search within a 1:n association. Let's repeat
the searches we just did with `includes` instead of `joins`:

[source,bash]
----
>> Category.includes(:products).where(:products => {name: "Strawberry"})
  SQL (0.4ms)  SELECT "categories"."id" AS t0_r0, "categories"."name"
  AS t0_r1, "categories"."created_at" AS t0_r2, "categories"."updated_at"
  AS t0_r3, "products"."id" AS t1_r0, "products"."name" AS t1_r1,
  "products"."price" AS t1_r2, "products"."category_id" AS t1_r3,
  "products"."created_at" AS t1_r4, "products"."updated_at" AS t1_r5
  FROM "categories" LEFT OUTER JOIN "products" ON
  "products"."category_id" = "categories"."id" WHERE
  "products"."name" = ?  [["name", "Strawberry"]]
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Category id: 1, name: "Fruits",
created_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:14", updated_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:14">,
#<Category id: 3, name: "Jams", created_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:14",
updated_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:14">]>
>> exit
----

In the console output, you can see that the SQL code is different from
the `joins` query.

`joins` only reads in the `Category` records and `includes` also reads the
associated `Product` records.

[[joins-vs.-includes]]
==== joins vs. includes

Why would you want to use `includes` at all? Well, if you already know
before the query that you will later need all products data, then it makes
sense to use `includes`, because then you only need one database query.
That is a lot faster than starting a seperate query for each n.

In that case, would it not be better to always work with `includes`? No,
it depends on the specific case. When you are using `includes`, a lot
more data is transported initially. This has to be cached and processed
by ActiveRecord, which takes longer and requires more resources.

[[delete-and-destroy]]
=== delete and destroy

With the methods `destroy`, `destroy_all`, `delete` and `delete_all` you
can delete records, as described in
xref:deletedestroy-a-record["Delete/Destroy a Record"]. In the context
of `has_many`, this means that you can delete the `Product` records
associated with a `Category` in one go:

[source,bash]
----

[[options]]
=== Options

I can't comment on all possible options at this point. But I'd like to
show you the most often used ones. For all others, please refer to the
Ruby on Rails documentation that you can find on the Internet at
http://rails.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html.

[[belongs_to]]
==== belongs_to

The most important option for `belongs_to` is.

[[touch-true]]
touch: true

It automatically sets the field `updated_at` of the entry in the table
`Category` to the current time when an `Product` is edited. In the
`app/models/product.rb`, it would look like this:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :category, touch: true
end
----

[[has_many]]
==== has_many

The most important options for `has_many` are.

[[dependent-destroy]]
dependent: :destroy

If a category is removed, then it usually makes sense to also automatically
remove all products dependent on this category. This can be done via
`:dependent => :destroy` in the `app/models/category.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/category.rb
----
class Category < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :products, dependent: :destroy
end
----

In the following example, we destroy the last category in the database
table. All products of this category are also automatically destroyed:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 47105
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Product.count
   (0.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "products"
=> 6
>> Category.last.destroy
  Category Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  "categories".* FROM "categories"
  ORDER BY "categories"."id" DESC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  Product Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "products".* FROM "products"
  WHERE "products"."category_id" = ?  [["category_id", 3]]
  SQL (0.6ms)  DELETE FROM "products" WHERE "products"."id" = ?  [["id", 10]]
  SQL (0.1ms)  DELETE FROM "products" WHERE "products"."id" = ?  [["id", 11]]
  SQL (0.1ms)  DELETE FROM "categories" WHERE "categories"."id" = ?  [["id", 3]]
   (4.7ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Category id: 3, name: "Jams", created_at: "2017-03-23 14:33:14",
updated_at: "2017-03-23 15:02:08">
>> Product.count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "products"
=> 4
>> exit
----

IMPORTANT: Please always remember the difference between the methods
           `destroy` (see xref:destroy["destroy"]) and `delete`
           (see xref:delete[the "delete"]). This association only works
           with the method `destroy`.

[[many-to-many-nn-association]]
== Many-to-Many – n:n Association

Up to now, we have always associated a database table directly with
another table. For many-to-many, we will associate two tables via a
third table. As example for this kind of relation, we use an order in
an online shop. In this type of shop system, a `Product` can
appear in several orders (`Order`) and at the same time an order can
contain several products. This is referred to as many-to-many. Let's
recreate this scenario with code.

[[preparation]]
=== Preparation

Create the shop application:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new online_shop
  [...]
$ cd online_shop
----

A model for products:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model product name 'price:decimal{7,2}'
----

A model for an order:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model order delivery_address
----

And a model for individual items of an order:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model line_item order:references \
product:references quantity:integer
----

Then, create the database:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:migrate
----

And setup some example data:

[source,ruby]
.db/seeds.rb
----
Product.create(name: 'Milk', price: 0.45)
Product.create(name: 'Butter', price: 0.75)
Product.create(name: 'Flour', price: 0.45)
Product.create(name: 'Eggs', price: 1.45)
----

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:seed
----

[[the-association]]
=== The Association

An order (`Order`) consists of one or several items (`LineItem`). This
LineItem consists of the `order_id`, a `product_id` and the number of
items ordered (`quantity`). The individual product is defined in the
product database (`Product`).

Associating the models happens as always in the directory `app/models`.
First, in the file `app/models/order.rb:`

[source,ruby]
.app/models/order.rb
----
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :line_items
  has_many :products, through: :line_items
end
----

Then in the counterpart in the file `app/models/product.rb:`

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :line_items
  has_many :orders, through: :line_items
end
----

The file `app/models/line_item.rb:` has been filled by the generator:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/line_item.rb
----
class LineItem < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :order
  belongs_to :product
end
----

[[the-association-works-transparent]]
=== The Association Works Transparent

As we implement the associations via `has_many`, most things will
already be familiar to you from the
section xref:has95many-1n-association["has_many - 1:n Association"].
I am going to show a few examples.

We create a new `Order` object:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 48290
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> order = Order.new(delivery_address: '123 Acme Street')
=> #<Order id: nil, delivery_address: "123 Acme Street",
created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
----

Logically, this new order does not yet contain any products:

[source,bash]
----
>> order.products.count
=> 0
----

As often, there are several ways of adding products to the order. The
simplest way: as the products are integrated as array, you can simply
insert them as elements of an array:

[source,bash]
----
>> order.products << Product.first
  Product Load (0.5ms)  SELECT  "products".* FROM "products"
  ORDER BY "products"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy
[#<Product id: 1, name: "Milk", price: 0.45e0,
created_at: "2017-03-23 15:14:22",
updated_at: "2017-03-23 15:14:22">]>
----

But if the customer wants to buy three times milk instead of one, we
need to enter it in the `LineItem` (in the linking element)
table. ActiveRecord already build an object for us:

[source,bash]
----
>> order.line_items
=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy
[#<LineItem id: nil, order_id: nil, product_id: 1, quantity: nil,
created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>]>
----

And we have access to it. So we can change the quanitity:

[source,bash]
----
>> order.line_items.first.quantity = 3
=> 3
----

But neither the `order` nor any other object is yet saved in the database.
We have to call the `save` method to do this:

[source,bash]
----
>> order.save
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.6ms)  INSERT INTO "orders" ("delivery_address", "created_at",
  "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?)  [["delivery_address", "123 Acme Street"],
  ["created_at", "2017-03-23 15:22:48.536239"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-23 15:22:48.536239"]]
  SQL (0.2ms)  INSERT INTO "line_items" ("order_id", "product_id",
  "quantity", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
  [["order_id", 2], ["product_id", 1], ["quantity", 3],
  ["created_at", "2017-03-23 15:22:48.539047"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-23 15:22:48.539047"]]
   (2.1ms)  commit transaction
=> true
----

Alternatively, we can also buy butter twice directly by adding a
`LineItem`:

[source,bash]
----
>> order.line_items.create(product: Product.second, quantity: 2)
  Product Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "products".* FROM "products"
  ORDER BY "products"."id" ASC LIMIT ? OFFSET ?  [["LIMIT", 1],
  ["OFFSET", 1]]
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (2.1ms)  INSERT INTO "line_items" ("order_id", "product_id",
  "quantity", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
  [["order_id", 2], ["product_id", 2], ["quantity", 2],
  ["created_at", "2017-03-23 15:25:32.991756"],
  ["updated_at", "2017-03-23 15:25:32.991756"]]
   (2.2ms)  commit transaction
=> #<LineItem id: 3, order_id: 2, product_id: 2, quantity: 2,
created_at: "2017-03-23 15:25:32", updated_at: "2017-03-23 15:25:32">
----

All searches and queries (including joins and includes) work for
you as a Rails programmer the same as without the has_many through.
ActiveRecord takes care of the details.

[[polymorphic-associations]]
== Polymorphic Associations

Already the word "polymorphic" will probably make you tense up. What can
it mean? Here is what the website
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html
tells us: “Polymorphic associations on models are not restricted on what
types of models they can be associated with.” Well, there you go - as
clear as mud! ;-)

I am showing you an example in which we create a `Car`model and a `Bike`
model.. To describe a car or bike, we use a `Tag` model. A car and a bike
can have any number of `tags`.

The application:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new bike_car_example
  [...]
$ cd bike_car_example
----

Now the three required models:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model Car name
  [...]
$ rails generate model Bike name
  [...]
$ rails generate model Tag name taggable:references{polymorphic}
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
----

`Car` and `Bike` are clear. For `Tag` we use the migration shortcut
`taggable:references{polymorphic}` to generate the fields
`taggable_type` and `taggable_id`, to give ActiveRecord an opportunity
to save the assignment for the polymorphic association. We have to enter
it accordingly in the model.

The model generator already filed the `app/models/tag.rb` file with the
configuration for the polymorphic association:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/tag.rb
----
class Tag < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :taggable, polymorphic: true
end
----

For the other models we have to add the polymorphic association
manually:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/car.rb
----
class Car < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :tags, as: :taggable
end
----

[source,ruby]
.app/models/bike.rb
----
class Bike < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :tags, as: :taggable
end
----

For `Car` and `Bike` we use an additional `:as: :taggable` when defining
`has_many`. For Tag we use `belongs_to :taggable, polymorphic: true` to
indicate the polymorphic association to ActiveRecord.

TIP: The suffix “_able_” in the name “_taggable_” is commonly used in
     Rails, but not obligatory. For creating the association we now not
     only need the ID of the entry, but also need to know which _model_
     it actually is. So the term “_taggable_type_” makes sense.

Let's go into the _console_ and create a car and a bike:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> beetle = Car.create(name: 'Beetle')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.8ms)  INSERT INTO "cars" ("name", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES
  (?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Beetle"], ["created_at", "2015-12-17
  13:39:54.793336"], ["updated_at", "2015-12-17 13:39:54.793336"]]
   (0.8ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Car id: 1, name: "Beetle", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:39:54", updated_at:
"2015-12-17 13:39:54">
>> mountainbike = Bike.create(name: 'Mountainbike')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.3ms)  INSERT INTO "bikes" ("name", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES
  (?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Mountainbike"], ["created_at", "2015-12-17

   (9.0ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Bike id: 1, name: "Mountainbike", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:39:55",
updated_at: "2015-12-17 13:39:55">
----

Now we define for each a tag with the color of the corresponding object:

[source,bash]
----
>> beetle.tags.create(name: 'blue')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (1.0ms)  INSERT INTO "tags" ("name", "taggable_id", "taggable_type",
  "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "blue"],
  ["taggable_id", 1], ["taggable_type", "Car"], ["created_at", "2015-12-17
  13:41:04.984444"], ["updated_at", "2015-12-17 13:41:04.984444"]]
   (0.9ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Tag id: 1, name: "blue", taggable_id: 1, taggable_type: "Car",
created_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:04", updated_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:04">
>> mountainbike.tags.create(name: 'black')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.7ms)  INSERT INTO "tags" ("name", "taggable_id", "taggable_type",
  "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "black"],
  ["taggable_id", 1], ["taggable_type", "Bike"], ["created_at", "2015-12-17
  13:41:17.315318"], ["updated_at", "2015-12-17 13:41:17.315318"]]
   (8.2ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Tag id: 2, name: "black", taggable_id: 1, taggable_type: "Bike",
created_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:17", updated_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:17">
----

For the `beetle`, we add another `Tag`:

[source,bash]
----
>> beetle.tags.create(name: 'Automatic')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.4ms)  INSERT INTO "tags" ("name", "taggable_id", "taggable_type",
  "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Automatic"],
  ["taggable_id", 1], ["taggable_type", "Car"], ["created_at", "2015-12-17
  13:41:51.042746"], ["updated_at", "2015-12-17 13:41:51.042746"]]
   (9.2ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Tag id: 3, name: "Automatic", taggable_id: 1, taggable_type: "Car",
created_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:51", updated_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:51">
----

Let's have a look at all Tag items:

[source,bash]
----
>> Tag.all
  Tag Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "tags".* FROM "tags"
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Tag id: 1, name: "blue", taggable_id: 1,
taggable_type: "Car", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:04", updated_at:
"2015-12-17 13:41:04">, #<Tag id: 2, name: "black", taggable_id: 1,
taggable_type: "Bike", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:17", updated_at:
"2015-12-17 13:41:17">, #<Tag id: 3, name: "Automatic", taggable_id: 1,
taggable_type: "Car", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:51", updated_at:
"2015-12-17 13:41:51">]>
----

And now all tags of the beetle:

[source,bash]
----
>> beetle.tags
  Tag Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "tags".* FROM "tags" WHERE "tags"."taggable_id" = ?
  AND "tags"."taggable_type" = ?  [["taggable_id", 1], ["taggable_type",
  "Car"]]
=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy [#<Tag id: 1, name: "blue",
taggable_id: 1, taggable_type: "Car", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:04",
updated_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:04">, #<Tag id: 3, name: "Automatic",
taggable_id: 1, taggable_type: "Car", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:51",
updated_at: "2015-12-17 13:41:51">]>
----

Of course you can also check which object the last Tag belongs to:

[source,bash]
----
>> Tag.last.taggable
  Tag Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "tags".* FROM "tags"  ORDER BY "tags"."id" DESC
  LIMIT 1
  Car Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  "cars".* FROM "cars" WHERE "cars"."id" = ? LIMIT 1
  [["id", 1]]
=> #<Car id: 1, name: "Beetle", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:39:54", updated_at:
"2015-12-17 13:39:54">
>> exit
----

Polymorphic associations are always useful if you want to normalize the
database structure. In this example, we could also have defined a model
`CarTag` and `BikeTag`, but as `Tag` is the same for both, a polymorphic
association makes more sense in this case.

[[options-2]]
=== Options

Polymorphic associations can be configured with the same options as a
normal xref:#has95many-1n-association[has_many association].

[[deletedestroy-a-record]]
== Delete/Destroy a Record

To remove a database record, you can use the methods `destroy` and
`delete`. It's quite easy to confuse these two terms, but they are
different and after a while you get used to it.

As an example, we use the following Rails application:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new bookshelf
  [...]
$ cd bookshelf
$ rails generate model book title
  [...]
$ rails generate model author book:references first_name last_name
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
$
----

[source,ruby]
.app/models/book.rb
----
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :authors, dependent: :destroy
end
----

[source,ruby]
.app/models/author.rb
----
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :book
end
----

[[destroy]]
=== destroy

With `destroy` you can remove a record and any existing dependencies are
also taken into account (see for example `:dependent => :destroy` in
the section xref:options["options"]). Simply put: to be on the
safe side, it's better to use `destroy` because then the Rails system
does more for you.

Let's create a record and then destroy it again:

[source,bash]
----

As we are using the option `dependent: :destroy` in the Book model, we
can also automatically remove all authors:

   last_name: 'Frisch')

----

When removing records, please always consider the difference between the
content of the database table and the value of the currently removed
object. The instance is _frozen_ after removing the database field. So
it is no longer in the database, but still present in the program, yet
it can no longer be modified there. It is read-only. To check, you can
use the method `frozen?`:

[source,bash]
----
>> book = Book.create(title: 'Homo faber')
   (0.2ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "books" ("title", "created_at", "updated_at")
  VALUES (?, ?, ?)  [["title", "Homo faber"], ["created_at", "2015-12-17

   (8.9ms)  commit transaction

>> book.destroy
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  Author Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "authors".* FROM "authors" WHERE
  "authors"."book_id" = ?  [["book_id", 3]]
  SQL (0.5ms)  DELETE FROM "books" WHERE "books"."id" = ?  [["id", 3]]
   (9.2ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Book id: 3, title: "Homo faber", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:51:41",

>> Book.count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "books"

>> book

updated_at: "2015-12-17 13:51:41">
>> book.frozen?
=> true
----

The record has been removed from the database, but the object with all
its data is still present in the running Ruby program. So could we then
revive the entire record? The answer is yes, but it will then be a new
record:

[source,bash]
----
>> Book.create(title: book.title)
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.3ms)  INSERT INTO "books" ("title", "created_at", "updated_at")
  VALUES (?, ?, ?)  [["title", "Homo faber"], ["created_at", "2015-12-17
  13:52:51.438501"], ["updated_at", "2015-12-17 13:52:51.438501"]]
   (8.7ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Book id: 4, title: "Homo faber", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:52:51",
updated_at: "2015-12-17 13:52:51">
>> exit
----

[[delete]]
=== delete

With `delete` you can remove a record directly from the database. Any
dependencies to other records in the _model_ are not taken into account.
The method `delete` only deletes that one row in the database and
nothing else.

Let's create a book with one author and then remove the book with
`delete`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:reset
  [...]
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Book.create(title: 'Homo faber').authors.create(first_name: 'Max',
   last_name: 'Frisch')
   (0.5ms)  begin transaction
   [...]
   (0.8ms)  commit transaction
=> #<Author id: 1, book_id: 1, first_name: "Max", last_name: "Frisch",
created_at: "2015-12-17 13:54:46", updated_at: "2015-12-17 13:54:46">
>> Author.count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "authors"
=> 1
>> Book.last.delete
  Book Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "books".* FROM "books"  ORDER BY "books"."id"
  DESC LIMIT 1
  SQL (1.5ms)  DELETE FROM "books" WHERE "books"."id" = ?  [["id", 1]]
=> #<Book id: 1, title: "Homo faber", created_at: "2015-12-17 13:54:46",
updated_at: "2015-12-17 13:54:46">
>> Author.count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "authors"
=> 1
>> Book.count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "books"
=> 0
>> exit
----

The record of the book 'Homo faber' is deleted, but the author is still
in the database.

As with `destroy`, an object also gets frozen when you use `delete` (see
xref:destroy["destroy"]). The record is already
removed from the database, but the object itself is still there.

[[transactions]]
== Transactions

In the world of databases, the term transaction refers to a block of SQL
statements that must be executed together and without interruption. If
an error should occur within the transaction, the database is reset to
the state before the start of the transaction.

Now and again, there are areas of application where you need to carry
out a database transaction. The classic example is transferring money
from one account to another. That only makes sense if both actions
(debiting one account and crediting the recipient's account) are
executed.

A transaction follows this pattern:

[source,ruby]
----
ApplicationRecord.transaction do
  Book.create(:title => 'A')
  Book.create(:title => 'B')
  Book.create(:title => 'C').authors.create(:last_name => 'Z')
end
----

Transactions are a complex topic. If you want to find out more, you can
consult the ri help on the shell via
`ri ActiveRecord::Transactions::ClassMethods`.

IMPORTANT: The methods `save` and `destroy` are automatically executed
           within the transaction _wrapper_. That way, Rails ensures
           that no undefined state can arise for these two methods.

WARNING: Transactions are not natively supported by all databases. In that
         case, the code will still work, but you no longer have the
         security of the transaction.

[[scopes]]
== Scopes

When programming Rails applications, it is sometimes clearer and simpler
to define frequent searches as separate methods. In Rails speak, these
are referred to as _NamedScope_. These NamedScopes can be chained, just
like other methods.

[[preparation-2]]
=== Preparation

We build a little online shop:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new shop
  [...]
$ cd shop
$ rails generate model product name 'price:decimal{7,2}' \
weight:integer in_stock:boolean expiration_date:date
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
$
----

Please populate the file `db/seeds.rb` with the following content:

[source,ruby]
.db/seeds.rb
----
Product.create(name: 'Milk (1 liter)', weight: 1000, in_stock: true, price:
0.45, expiration_date: Date.today + 14.days)
Product.create(name: 'Butter (250 g)', weight: 250, in_stock: true, price:
0.75, expiration_date: Date.today + 14.days)
Product.create(name: 'Flour (1 kg)', weight: 1000, in_stock: false, price:
0.45, expiration_date: Date.today + 100.days)
Product.create(name: 'Jelly Babies (6 x 300 g)', weight: 1500, in_stock: true,
price: 4.96, expiration_date: Date.today + 1.year)
Product.create(name: 'Super-Duper Cake Mix', in_stock: true, price: 11.12,
expiration_date: Date.today + 1.year)
Product.create(name: 'Eggs (12)', in_stock: true, price: 2, expiration_date:
Date.today + 7.days)
Product.create(name: 'Peanuts (8 x 200 g bag)', in_stock: false, weight: 1600,
price: 17.49, expiration_date: Date.today + 1.year)
----

Now drop the database and repopulate it with the `db/seeds.rb`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:reset
  [...]
$
----

[[defining-a-scope]]
=== Defining a Scope

If we want to count products that are in stock in our online shop, then
we can use the following query each time:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Product.where(in_stock: true).count
   (0.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "products" WHERE "products"."in_stock" = 't'
=> 5
>> exit
----

But we could also define a NamedScope `available` in the
`app/models/product.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  scope :available, -> { where(in_stock: true) }
end
----

And then use it:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Product.available.count
   (0.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "products" WHERE "products"."in_stock" = 't'
=> 5
>> exit
----

Let's define a second NamedScope for this example in the
`app/models/product.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  scope :available, -> { where(in_stock: true) }
  scope :cheap, -> { where(price: 0..1) }
end
----

Now we can chain both named scopes to output all cheap products that are
in stock:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Product.cheap.count
   (0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "products" WHERE ("products"."price" BETWEEN
   0 AND 1)
=> 3
>> Product.cheap.available.count
   (0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "products" WHERE ("products"."price" BETWEEN
   0 AND 1) AND "products"."in_stock" = 't'
=> 2
>> exit
----

[[passing-in-arguments]]
=== Passing in Arguments

If you need a NamedScope that can also process parameters, then that is
no problem either. The following example outputs products that are
cheaper than the specified value. The `app/models/product.rb` looks like
this:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  scope :cheaper_than, ->(price) { where("price < ?", price) }
end
----

Now we can count all products that cost less than 50 cent:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Product.cheaper_than(0.5).count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "products" WHERE (price < 0.5)
=> 2
>> exit
----

[[creating-new-records-with-scopes]]
=== Creating New Records with Scopes

Let's use the following `app/models/product.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  scope :available, -> { where(in_stock: true) }
end
----

With this NamedScope we can not only find all products that are in
stock, but also create new products that contain the value `true` in the
field `in_stock`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> product = Product.available.build
=> #<Product id: nil, name: nil, price: nil, weight: nil, in_stock: true,
expiration_date: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> product.in_stock
=> true
>> exit
----

This works with the method `build` (see xref:build["build"]) and
`create` (see xref:create["create"]).

[[validation]]
== Validation

Non-valid records are frequently a source of errors in programs. With
`validates`, Rails offers a quick and easy way of validating them. That
way you can be sure that only meaningful records will find their way
into your database.

[[preparation-3]]
=== Preparation

Let's create a new application for this chapter:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new shop
  [...]
$ cd shop
$ rails generate model product name 'price:decimal{7,2}' \
weight:integer in_stock:boolean expiration_date:date
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
$
----

[[the-basic-idea]]
=== The Basic Idea

For each model, there is a matching model file in the directory
`app/models/`. In this Ruby code, we can not only define database
dependencies, but also implement all validations. The advantage: Every
programmer knows where to find it.

Without any validation, we can create an empty record in a model without
a problem:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> product = Product.create
[...]
=> #<Product id: 1, name: nil, price: nil, weight: nil,
in_stock: nil, expiration_date: nil, created_at: "2016-01-21 13:18:31",
updated_at: "2016-01-21 13:18:31">
>> exit
----

But in practice, this record with no content doesn't make any sense. A
`Product` needs to have a `name` and a `price`. That's why we can define
validations in ActiveRecord. Then you can ensure as programmer that only
records that are valid for you are saved in your database.

To make the mechanism easier to understand, I am going to jump ahead a
bit and use the `presence` helper. Please fill your
`app/models/product.rb` with the following content:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name,
            presence: true

  validates :price,
            presence: true
end
----

Now we try again to create an empty record in the console:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> product = Product.create
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
   (0.1ms)  rollback transaction
=> #<Product id: nil, name: nil, price: nil, weight: nil, in_stock: nil,
expiration_date: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
----

Watch out for the `rollback transaction` part and the missing `id` of
the `Product` object! Rails began the transaction of creating a new
record but for some reason it couldn't do it. So it had to rollback the
transaction. The validation method intervened before the record was
saved. So validating happens before saving.

Can we access the errors? Yes, via the method `errors` or with
`errors.messages` we can look at the errors that occurred:

[source,bash]
----
>> product.errors
=> #<ActiveModel::Errors:0x007ff515a71680 @base=#<Product id: nil, name: nil,
price: nil, weight: nil, in_stock: nil, expiration_date: nil, created_at: nil,
updated_at: nil>, @messages={:name=>["can't be blank"], :price=>["can't be
blank"]}>
>> product.errors.messages
=> {:name=>["can't be blank"], :price=>["can't be blank"]}
----

This error message was defined for a human and English-speaking user.

Only once we assign a value to the attributes `name` and `price`, we can
save the object:

[source,bash]
----
>> product.name = 'Milk (1 liter)'
=> "Milk (1 liter)"
>> product.price = 0.45
=> 0.45
>> product.save
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "products" ("name", "price", "created_at",
  "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Milk (1 liter)"], ["price",
  0.45], ["created_at", "2015-12-17 17:59:09.293831"], ["updated_at",
  "2015-12-17 17:59:09.293831"]]
   (9.0ms)  commit transaction
=> true
----

[[valid]]
==== `valid?`

The method `valid?` indicates in boolean form if an object is valid. So
you can check the validity already before you save:

[source,bash]
----
>> product = Product.new
=> #<Product id: nil, name: nil, price: nil, weight: nil, in_stock: nil,
expiration_date: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> product.valid?
=> false
----

[[save-validate-false]]
==== save( validate: false )

As so often in life, you can find a way around everything. If you pass
the parameter `:validate => false` to the method `save`, the data of
`Validation` is saved:

[source,bash]
----
>> product = Product.new
=> #<Product id: nil, name: nil, price: nil, weight: nil, in_stock: nil,
expiration_date: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> product.valid?
=> false
>> product.save
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
   (0.1ms)  rollback transaction
=> false
>> product.save(validate: false)
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "products" ("created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?,
  ?)  [["created_at", "2015-12-17 18:01:46.173590"], ["updated_at",
  "2015-12-17 18:01:46.173590"]]
   (9.1ms)  commit transaction
=> true
>> exit
----

WARNING: I assume that you understand the problems involved here.
         Please only use this option if there is a really good reason
         to do so.

[[presence]]
=== presence

In our model `product` there are a few fields that must be filled in in
any case. We can achieve this via `presence`.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name,
            presence: true

  validates :price,
            presence: true
end
----

If we try to create an empty user record with this, we get lots of
validation errors:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> product = Product.create
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
   (0.1ms)  rollback transaction
=> #<Product id: nil, name: nil, price: nil, weight: nil, in_stock: nil,
expiration_date: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> product.errors.messages
=> {:name=>["can't be blank"], :price=>["can't be blank"]}
----

Only once we have entered all the data, the record can be saved:

[source,bash]
----
>> product.name = 'Milk (1 liter)'
=> "Milk (1 liter)"
>> product.price = 0.45
=> 0.45
>> product.save
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.6ms)  INSERT INTO "products" ("name", "price", "created_at",
  "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Milk (1 liter)"], ["price",
  0.45], ["created_at", "2015-12-17 18:04:26.587946"], ["updated_at",
  "2015-12-17 18:04:26.587946"]]
   (9.2ms)  commit transaction
=> true
>> exit
----

[[length]]
=== length

With `length` you can limit the length of a specific attribute. It's
easiest to explain using an example. Let us limit the maximum length of
the name to 20 and the minimum to 2.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name,
            presence: true,
            length: { in: 2..20 }

  validates :price,
            :presence => true
end
----

If we now try to save a Product with a name that consists in one letter,
we get an error message:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> product = Product.create(:name => 'M', :price => 0.45)
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
   (0.1ms)  rollback transaction
=> #<Product id: nil, name: "M", price:
#<BigDecimal:7ff735513400,'0.45E0',9(27)>, weight: nil, in_stock: nil,
expiration_date: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> product.errors.messages
=> {:name=>["is too short (minimum is 2 characters)"]}
----

[[options-3]]
==== Options

`length` can be called with the following options.

[[minimum-1]]
minimum

The minimum length of an attribute. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :name,
          presence: true,
          length: { minimum: 2 }
----

[[too_short]]
too_short

Defines the error message of :minimum. Default: "is too short (min is %d
characters)". Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :name,
          presence: true,
          length: { minimum: 5 ,
          too_short: "must have at least %{count} characters"}
----

[[maximum-1]]
maximum

The maximum length of an attribute. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :name,
          presence: true,
          length: { maximum: 20 }
----

[[too_long]]
too_long

Defines the error message of :maximum. Default: "is too long (maximum is
%d characters)". Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :name,
          presence: true,
          length: { maximum: 20 ,
          too_long: "must have at most %{count} characters" }
----

NOTE: For all error messages, please note the chapter
      xref:internationalization[Internationalization].

[[is]]
is

Is exactly the specified number of characters long. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :name,
          presence: true,
          length: { is: 8 }
----

[[in-or-within]]
:in or :within

Defines a length interval. The first number specifies the minimum number
of the range and the second the maximum. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :name,
          presence: true,
          length: { in: 2..20 }
----

[[tokenizer]]
tokenizer

You can use this to define how the attribute should be split for
counting. Default: `lambda{ |value| value.split(//) }` (individual
characters are counted). Example (for counting words):

[source,ruby]
----
validates :content,
          presence: true,
          length: { in: 2..20 },
          tokenizer: lambda {|str| str.scan(/\w+/)}
----

[[numericality]]
=== numericality

With `numericality` you can check if an attribute is a number. It's
easier to explain if we use an example.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name,
            presence: true,
            length: { in: 2..20 }

  validates :price,
            presence: true

  validates :weight,
            numericality: true
end
----

If we now use a `weight` that consists of letters or contains letters
instead of numbers, we will get an error message:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> product = Product.create(name: 'Milk (1 liter)',
   price: 0.45, weight: 'abc')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
   (0.1ms)  rollback transaction
=> #<Product id: nQil, name: "Milk (1 liter)",
price: #<BigDecimal:7fca1ec90ed8,'0.45E0',9(27)>, weight: 0,
in_stock: nil, expiration_date: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> product.errors.messages
=> {:weight=>["is not a number"]}
>> exit
----

TIP: You can use `numericality` to define the content as number even
     if an attribute is saved as string in the database.

[[options-4]]
==== Options

`numericality` can be called with the following options.

[[only_integer]]
only_integer

The attribute can only contain an integer. Default: false. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :weight,
          numericality: { only_integer: true }
----

[[greater_than]]
greater_than

The number saved in the attribute must be greater than the specified
value. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :weight,
          numericality: { greater_than: 100 }
----

[[greater_than_or_equal_to]]
greater_than_or_equal_to

The number saved in the attribute must be greater than or equal to the
specified value. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :weight,
          numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 100 }
----

[[equal_to]]
equal_to

Defines a specific value that the attribute must have. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :weight,
          numericality: { equal_to: 100 }
----

[[less_than]]
less_than

The number saved in the attribute must be less than the specified value.
Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :weight,
          numericality: { less_than: 100 }
----

[[less_than_or_equal_to]]
less_than_or_equal_to

The number saved in the attribute must be less than or equal to the
specified value. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :weight,
          numericality: { less_than_or_equal_to: 100 }
----

[[odd]]
odd

The number saved in the attribute must be an odd number. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :weight,
          numericality: { odd: true }
----

[[even]]
even

The number saved in the attribute must be an even number. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :weight,
          numericality: { even: true }
----

[[uniqueness]]
=== uniqueness

With uniqueness you can define that the value of this attribute must be
unique in the database. If you want a product in the database to have a
unique name that appears nowhere else, then you can use this validation:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name,
            presence: true,
            uniqueness: true
end
----

If we now try to create a new `Product` with a `name` that already
exists, then we get an error message:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Product.last
  Product Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "products".* FROM "products"
  ORDER BY "products"."id" DESC LIMIT 1
=> #<Product id: 4, name: "Milk (1 liter)", price:
#<BigDecimal:7fdccb1960b8,'0.45E0',9(27)>, weight: nil,
in_stock: nil, expiration_date: nil,
created_at: "2015-12-17 18:04:26",
updated_at: "2015-12-17 18:04:26">
>> product = Product.create(name: 'Milk (1 liter)')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  Product Exists (0.2ms)  SELECT  1 AS one FROM "products"
  WHERE "products"."name" = 'Milk (1 liter)' LIMIT 1
   (0.1ms)  rollback transaction
=> #<Product id: nil, name: "Milk (1 liter)", price: nil,
weight: nil, in_stock: nil, expiration_date: nil,
created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> product.errors.messages
=> {:name=>["has already been taken"]}
>> exit
----

WARNING: The validation via `uniqueness` is no absolute guarantee that
         the attribute is unique in the database. A race condition
         could occur (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition).
         A detailled discussion of this effect would go beyond the scope
         of book aimed at beginners (this phenomenon is extremely rare).

[[options-5]]
==== Options

`uniqueness` can be called with the following options.

[[scope]]
scope

Defines a scope for the uniqueness. If we had a differently structured
phone number database (with just one field for the phone number), then
we could use this option to specify that a phone number must only be
saved once per user. Here is what it would look like:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :name,
          presence: true,
          uniqueness: { scope: :user_id }
----

[[case_sensitive]]
case_sensitive

Checks for uniqueness of upper and lower case as well. Default: false.
Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :name,
          presence: true,
          uniqueness: { case_sensitive: true }
----

[[inclusion]]
=== inclusion

With `inclusion` you can define from which values the content of this
attribute can be created. For our example, we can demonstrate it using
the attribute `in_stock`.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name,
            presence: true

  validates :in_stock,
            inclusion: { in: [true, false] }
end
----

In our data model, a `Product` must be either `true` or `false` for
`in_stock` (there must not be a nil). If we enter a different value than
`true` or `false`, a validation error is returned:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> product = Product.create(name: 'Milk low-fat (1 liter)')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
   (0.1ms)  rollback transaction
=> #<Product id: nil, name: "Milk low-fat (1 liter)", price: nil, weight: nil,
in_stock: nil, expiration_date: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> product.errors.messages
=> {:in_stock=>["is not included in the list"]}
>> exit
----

TIP: Always remember the power of Ruby! For example, you can generate the
     enumerable object always live from another database. In other words,
     the validation is not defined statically.

[[options-6]]
==== Options

`inclusion` can be called with the following option.

[[message]]
message

For outputting custom error messages. Default: "is not included in the
list". Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :in_stock,
          inclusion: { in: [true, false],
                       message: 'this one is not allowed' }
----

NOTE: For all error messages, please note the chapter
      xref:internationalization[Internationalization].

[[exclusion]]
=== exclusion

`exclusion` is the inversion of xref:inclusion[inclusion].
You can define from which values the content of this
attribute must not be created.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name,
            presence: true

  validates :in_stock,
            exclusion: { in: [nil] }
end
----

TIP: Always remember the power of Ruby! For example, you can generate the
     enumerable object always live from another database. In other words, the
     validation does not have to be defined statically.

[[options-7]]
==== Options

`exclusion` can be called with the following option.

[[message-1]]
message

For outputting custom error messages. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :in_stock,
          inclusion: { in: [nil],
                       message: 'this one is not allowed' }
----

NOTE: For all error messages, please note the chapter
      xref:internationalization[Internationalization].

[[format]]
=== format

With `format` you can define via a regular expression (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) how the content of an
attribute can be structured.

With `format` you can for example carry out a simple validation of the
syntax of an e-mail address:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :email,
          format: { with: /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\Z/i }
----

WARNING: It should be obvious that the e-mail address validation shown
         here is not complete. It is just meant to be an example. You
         can only use it to check the syntactic correctness of an e-mail
         address.

[[options-8]]
==== Options

`validates_format_of` can be called with the following options:

* `:message`
+
For outputting a custom error message. Default: "is invalid". Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :email,
          format: { with: /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\Z/i,
                       message: 'is not a valid email address' }
----

NOTE: For all error messages, please note the chapter
      xref:internationalization[Internationalization].

[[general-validation-options]]
=== General Validation Options

There are some options that can be used for all validations.

[[allow_nil]]
==== `allow_nil`

Allows the value `nil`. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :email,
          format: { with: /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\Z/i },
          allow_nil: true
----

[[allow_blank]]
==== allow_blank

As `allow_nil`, but additionally with an empty string. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :email,
          format: { with: /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\Z/i },
          allow_blank: true
----

[[on]]
on
++

With `on`, a validation can be limited to the events `create`, `update`
or `safe`. In the following example, the validation only takes effect
when the record is initially created (during the `create`):

[source,ruby]
----
validates :email,
          format: { with: /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\Z/i },
          on: :create
----

[[if-and-unless]]
==== if and unless

`if` or `unless` call the specified method and only execute the
validation if the result of the method is true:

[source,ruby]
----
validates :name,
          presence: true,
          if: :today_is_monday?

def today_is_monday?
  Date.today.monday?
end
----

[[proc]]
proc

`:proc` calls a `Proc` object. The functionality of a `Proc` object is
beyond the scope of this book. I give you an example how to use it
without describing the magic behind.

[source,ruby]
----
validates :name,
          presence: true,
          if: Proc.new { |a| a.email == 'test@test.com' }
----

[[writing-custom-validations]]
=== Writing Custom Validations

Now and then, you want to do a validation where you need custom program
logic. For such cases, you can define custom validations.

[[defining-validations-with-your-own-methods]]
==== Defining Validations with Your Own Methods

Let's assume you are a big shot hotel mogul and need a reservation
system.

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new my_hotel
  [...]
$ cd my_hotel
$ rails generate model reservation \
start_date:date end_date:date room_type
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
$
----

Then we specify in the `app/models/reservation.rb` that the attributes
`start_date` and `end_date` must be present in any case, plus we use the
method `reservation_dates_must_make_sense` to make sure that the
`start_date` is before the `end_date`:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/reservation.rb
----
class Reservation < ApplicationRecord
  validates :start_date,
            presence: true

  validates :end_date,
            presence: true

  validate :reservation_dates_must_make_sense

  private
  def reservation_dates_must_make_sense
    if end_date <= start_date
      errors.add(:start_date, 'has to be before the end date')
    end
  end
end
----

With `errors.add` we can add error messages for individual attributes.
With `errors.add_to_base` you can add error messages for the whole
object.

Let's test the validation in the console:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> reservation = Reservation.new(start_date: Date.today, end_date: Date.today)
=> #<Reservation id: nil, start_date: "2015-12-17", end_date: "2015-12-17",
room_type: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> reservation.valid?
=> false
>> reservation.errors.messages
=> {:start_date=>["has to be before the end date"]}
>> reservation.end_date = Date.today + 1.day
=> Sat, 18 Apr 2015
>> reservation.valid?
=> true
>> reservation.save
[...]
=> true
>> exit
----

[[further-documentation]]
=== Further Documentation

The topic validations is described very well in the official Rails
documentation at
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html.

[[migrations]]
== Migrations

SQL database tables are generated in Rails with _migrations_ and they
should also be changed with _migrations_. If you create a model with
`rails generate model`, a corresponding migration file is automatically
created in the directory `db/migrate/`. I am going to show you the
principle using the example of a shop application. Let's create one
first:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new shop
  [...]
$ cd shop
----

Then we generate a Product model:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model product name 'price:decimal{7,2}' \
weight:integer in_stock:boolean expiration_date:date
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20151217184823_create_products.rb
      create    app/models/product.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/product_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/products.yml
$
----

The migrations file `db/migrate/20151217184823_create_products.rb` was
created. Let's have a closer look at it:

[source,ruby]
.db/migrate/20151217184823_create_products.rb
----
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.decimal :price, precision: 7, scale: 2
      t.integer :weight
      t.boolean :in_stock
      t.date :expiration_date

      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
----

The method `change` creates and deletes the database table in case of a
rollback. The migration files have embedded the current time in the file
name and are processed in chronological order during a migration (in
other words, when you call `rails db:migrate`).

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:migrate
== 20151217184823 CreateProducts: migrating ===================================
-- create_table(:products)
   -> 0.0015s
== 20151217184823 CreateProducts: migrated (0.0016s) ==========================
$
----

Only those migrations that have not been executed yet are processed. If
we call `rails db:migrate` again, nothing happens, because the
corresponding migration has already been executed:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:migrate
$
----

But if we manually delete the database with `rm` and then call
`rails db:migrate` again, the migration is repeated:

[source,bash]
----
$ rm db/development.sqlite3
$ rails db:migrate
== 20151217184823 CreateProducts: migrating ===================================
-- create_table(:products)
   -> 0.0017s
== 20151217184823 CreateProducts: migrated (0.0018s) ==========================
$
----

After a while we realise that we want to save not just the weight for
some products, but also the height. So we need another database field.
There is an easy to remember syntax for this,
`rails generate migration add_*`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate migration addHeightToProduct height:integer
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20151217185307_add_height_to_product.rb
$
----

In the migration file
`db/migrate/20151217185307_add_height_to_product.rb` we once again find
a change method:

[source,ruby]
.db/migrate/20151217185307_add_height_to_product.rb
----
class AddHeightToProduct < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :products, :height, :integer
  end
end
----

With `rails db:migrate` we can start in the new migration:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:migrate
== 20151217185307 AddHeightToProduct: migrating ===============================
-- add_column(:products, :height, :integer)
   -> 0.0086s
== 20151217185307 AddHeightToProduct: migrated (0.0089s) ======================
$
----

In the _console_ we can look at the new field. It was added after the
field `updated_at`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> Product.column_names
=> ["id", "name", "price", "weight", "in_stock", "expiration_date",
"created_at", "updated_at", "height"]
>> exit
----

IMPORTANT: Please note that you need to add the new field
           in `attr_accessible` in `app/models/product.rb`, otherwise
           you will not have access to the `height` attribute.

What if you want to look at the previous state of things? No problem.
You can easily go back to the previous version with `rails db:rollback`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:rollback
== 20151217185307 AddHeightToProduct: reverting ===============================
-- remove_column(:products, :height, :integer)
   -> 0.0076s
== 20151217185307 AddHeightToProduct: reverted (0.0192s) ======================
$
----

Each migration has its own version number. You can find out the version
number of the current status via `rails db:version`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:version
Current version: 20151217184823
$
----

IMPORTANT: Please note that all version numbers and timestamps only apply
           to the example printed here. If you recreate the example, you
           will of course get a different timestamp for your own example.

You will find the corresponding version in the directory `db/migrate`:

[source,bash]
----
$ ls db/migrate/
20151217184823_create_products.rb
20151217185307_add_height_to_product.rb
$
----

You can go to a specific migration via `rails db:migrate VERSION=` and
add the appropriate version number after the equals sign. The number
zero represents the version zero, in other words the start.

Let's try it out:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:migrate VERSION=0
== 20151217184823 CreateProducts: reverting ===================================
-- drop_table(:products)
   -> 0.0007s
== 20151217184823 CreateProducts: reverted (0.0032s) ==========================
$
----

The table was deleted with all data. We are back to square one.

[[which-database-is-used]]
=== Which Database is Used?

The database table is created through the migration. As you can see, the
table names automatically get the plural of the _model_s (`Person` vs.
`people`). But in which database are the tables created? This is defined
in the configuration file `config/database.yml`:

[source,yaml]
.config/database.yml
----
# SQLite version 3.x
#   gem install sqlite3
#
#   Ensure the SQLite 3 gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem 'sqlite3'
#
default: &default
  adapter: sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

development:
  <<: *default
  database: db/development.sqlite3

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: db/test.sqlite3

production:
  <<: *default
  database: db/production.sqlite3
----

Three different databases are defined there in YAML format (see
http://www.yaml.org/ or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). For us, only
the `development` database is relevant for now (first item). By default,
Rails usesSQLite3 there. SQLite3 may not be the correct choice for the
analysis of the weather data collected worldwide, but for a quick and
straightforward development of Rails applications you will quickly learn
to appreciate it. In the production environment, you can later still
switch to "big" databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

To satisfy your curiosity, we have a quick look at the database with the
command line tool `sqlite3`:

[source,bash]
----
$ sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3
SQLite version 3.8.5 2014-08-15 22:37:57
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables
schema_migrations
sqlite> .quit
$
----

Nothing in it. Of course not, as we have not yet run the migration:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:migrate
== 20151217184823 CreateProducts: migrating ===================================
-- create_table(:products)
   -> 0.0019s
== 20151217184823 CreateProducts: migrated (0.0020s) ==========================

== 20151217185307 AddHeightToProduct: migrating ===============================
-- add_column(:products, :height, :integer)
   -> 0.0007s

The table `schema_migrations` is used for the versioning of the
migrations. This table is created during the first migration carried out
by Rails, if it does not yet exist.

[[creating-index]]
=== Creating Index

I assume that you know what a database index is. If not, you will find a
brief introduction at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index. In
brief: you can use it to quickly search for a specific table column.

In our production database, we should index the field `name` in the
`products` table. We create a new migration for that purpose:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate migration create_index
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20151217190442_create_index.rb
$
----

In the file `db/migrate/20121120142002_create_index.rb` we create the
index with `add_index` in the method `self.up`, and in the method
`self.down` we delete it again with `remove_index`:

[source,ruby]
.db/migrate/20121120142002_create_index.rb
----
class CreateIndex < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    add_index :products, :name
  end

  def down
    remove_index :products, :name
  end
end
----

With `rails db:migrate` we create the index:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:migrate
==  CreateIndex: migrating ====================================================
-- add_index(:products, :name)
   -> 0.0010s
==  CreateIndex: migrated (0.0011s) ===========================================
$
----

Of course we don't have to use the `up` and `down` method. We can use
`change` too. The migration for the new index would look like this:

[source,ruby]
----
class CreateIndex < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    add_index :products, :name
  end
end
----

[TIP]
====
You can also create an index directly when you generate the model. In
our case (an index for the attribute `name`) the command would look like
this:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model product name:string:index
$ cat db/migrate/20151217191435_create_products.rb
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name

      t.timestamps null: false
    end
    add_index :products, :name
  end
end
----

[[automatically-added-fields-id-created_at-and-updated_at]]
=== Automatically Added Fields (`id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`)

Rails kindly adds the following fields automatically in the default
migration:

* `id:integer`
+
This is the unique ID of the record. The field is automatically
incremented by the database. For all SQL fans: `NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT`
* `created_at:datetime`
+
The field is filled automatically by ActiveRecord when a record is
created.
* `updated_at:datetime`
+
The field is automatically updated to the current time whenever the
record is edited.

So you don't have to enter these fields yourself when generating the
model.

At first you may ask yourself: "Is that really necessary? Does it make
sense?". But after a while you will learn to appreciate these automatic
fields. Omitting them would usually be false economy.

[[callbacks]]
== Callbacks

Callbacks are defined programming hooks in the life of an ActiveRecord
object. You can find a list of all callbacks at
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html. Here are
the most frequently used callbacks:

* `before_validation`
+
Executed before the validation.
* `after_validation`
+
Executed after the validation.
* `before_save`
+
Executed before each save.
* `before_create`
+
Executed before the first save.
* `after_save`
+
Executed after every save.
* `after_create`
+
Executed after the first save.

A callback is always executed in the model. Let's assume you always want
to save an e-mail address in a `User` model in lower case, but also give
the user of the web interface the option to enter upper case letters.
You could use a `before_save` callback to convert the attribute `email`
to lower case via the method `downcase`.

The Rails application:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new shop
  [...]
$ cd shop
$ rails generate model user email login
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
----

Here is what the model `app/models/user.rb` would look like. The
interesting stuff is the `before_save` part:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/user.rb
----
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :login,
            presence: true

  validates :email,
            presence: true,
            format: { :with => /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\Z/i }

  before_save :downcase_email

  private

  def downcase_email
    self.email = self.email.downcase
  end
end
----

Let's see in the console if it really works as we want it to:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> User.create(login: 'smith', email: 'SMITH@example.com')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "users" ("login", "email", "created_at",
  "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)  [["login", "smith"], ["email",
  "smith@example.com"], ["created_at", "2015-12-17 19:22:20.928994"],
  ["updated_at", "2015-12-17 19:22:20.928994"]]
   (9.0ms)  commit transaction
=> #<User id: 1, email: "smith@example.com", login: "smith", created_at:
"2015-12-17 19:22:20", updated_at: "2015-12-17 19:22:20">
>> exit
----

Even though the e-mail address was entered partly with a capital
letters, ActiveRecord has indeed converted all letters automatically to
lower case via the `before_save` callback.

In the chapter xref:action-mailer["Action Mailer"] you will
find an example for the same model where we use an `after_create`
callback to automatically send an e-mail to a newly created user.
In the section xref:default-values["Default Values"] you will find
an example for defining a default value for a new object via an
`after_initialize` callback.

[[default-values]]
== Default Values

If you need specific default values for an ActiveRecord object, you can
easily implement this with the `after_initialize` callback. This method
is called by ActiveRecord when a new object is created. Let's assume we
have a model `Order` and the minimum order quantity is always 1, so we
can enter 1 directly as default value when creating a new record.

Let's set up a quick example:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new shop
  [...]
$ cd shop
$ rails generate model order product_id:integer quantity:integer
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
----

We write an `after_initialize` callback into the file
`app/models/order.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/order.rb
----
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  after_initialize :set_defaults

  private
  def set_defaults
    self.quantity ||= 1
  end
end
----

And now we check in the console if a new order object automatically
contains the quantity 1:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 27927
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0.rc1)
>> order = Order.new
=> #<Order id: nil, product_id: nil, quantity: 1, created_at: nil,
updated_at: nil>
>> order.quantity
=> 1
>> exit
----

That's working fine.
