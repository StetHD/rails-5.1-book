[[production-webserver]]
= Web Server in Production Mode

This chapter walks you through the setup process of a production server which
runs Nginx as a reverse proxy webserver and Puma as the Ruby on Rails webserver
behind the Nginx. We start with a fresh Debian system and install all the
software we need. The Rails 5.1 project will be run with Ruby 2.4 which gets
installed with RVM and runs for the user deployer.

The example Rails application we use is called `blog`. It will contain a `post`
scaffold.

WARNING: If you have never set up a Nginx or Apache web server by
         yourself on a Linux system before you will likely get lost
         somewhere in this chapter.

[[debian-8.7]]
== Debian 8.7

We build our production web server on a minimal Debian 8.7 system. To
carry out this installation, you need to have root rights on the web
server!

This description assumes that you have a freshly installed Debian
GNU/Linux 8.7 (Jessie). You will find an ISO image for the installation
at http://www.debian.org. I recommend the approximately 250 MB net
installation CD image. For instructions on how to install
Debian-GNU/Linux, please go to http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst.

TIP: http://www.vmware.com/[VMware] or any other virtual PC system
     is a great playground to get a feeling how this works.

[[buildsystem]]
=== Buildsystem

Login as root, update the package lists and upgrade the system:

[source,bash]
----
root@debian:~# apt-get update
[..]
root@debian:~# apt-get upgrade
----

Installation of the packages required for the RVM installation:

[source,bash]
----
root@debian:~# apt-get -y install curl gawk g++ \
make libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev \
libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 autoconf \
libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev libtool bison nodejs \
pkg-config libffi-dev libgmp-dev libgmp-dev git
----

[[nginx]]
=== nginx

Nginx will be our web server to the outside world.

[source,bash]
----
root@debian:~# apt-get -y install nginx
----

[[user-deployer]]
=== User Deployer

Our Rails project is going use https://rvm.io[RVM] in the user space.
So we create a new user with the name `deployer`:

[source,bash]
----
root@debian:~# adduser deployer
Adding user `deployer' ...
Adding new group `deployer' (1001) ...
Adding new user `deployer' (1001) with group `deployer' ...
Creating home directory `/home/deployer' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for deployer
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
  Full Name []: Deployer
  Room Number []:
  Work Phone []:
  Home Phone []:
  Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] Y
root@debian:~#
----

[[database]]
=== Database

In this setup we use http://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] as our
production database.

[[postgresql-installation]]
==== PostgreSQL Installation

We need to install the database software:

[source,bash]
----
root@debian:~# apt-get -y install postgresql postgresql-client libpq-dev
----

To create a database user `deployer` and a database `blog_production` we need to
do the following steps:

[source,bash]
----
root@debian:~# su - postgres
postgres@debian:~$ createuser -W --createdb deployer
Password:
postgres@debian:~$ createdb blog_production
postgres@debian:~$ exit
logout
root@debian:~#
----

For this example we use the password _123456_. It should be obvious that this is
a bad idea for your application to copy.

[[setting-up-rails-environment-for-user-deployer]]
==== Setting up Rails Environment for User deployer

With `su - deployer` weâ€™ll become the user deployer:

[source,bash]
----
root@debian:~# su - deployer
----

As user `deployer`, please carry out the steps for installing Ruby 2.4
and Rails 5.1 via RVM.

[source,bash]
----
deployer@debian:~$ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net \
--recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
[...]
deployer@debian:~$ curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash
[...]
deployer@debian:~$ source /home/deployer/.rvm/scripts/rvm
deployer@debian:~$ rvm install 2.4 --autolibs=read-only
[...]
deployer@debian:~$ gem install rails
[...]
deployer@debian:~$
----

TIP: You need to run `gem install rails --pre` in case Rails 5.1 is still
     beta while you read this text.

[[setting-up-a-new-rails-project]]
== Setting Up a New Rails Project

To keep this guide as simple as possible, we create a simple blog in the
home directory of the user `deployer`.

[source,bash]
----
deployer@debian:~$ rails new blog --database=postgresql
[...]
deployer@debian:~$ cd blog
deployer@debian:~/blog$ rails generate scaffold post subject content:text
[...]
deployer@debian:~/blog$
----

NOTE: `--database=postgresql` takes care of installing the `pg` gem for
      using PostgreSQL. In case you already have a Rails application you
      need to add the line `gem 'pg'` to your Gemfile and run
      a `bundle install` afterwards.

[[production-database-configuration]]
=== Production Database Configuration

In the file `config/database.yml` you need to change the production database
user to `deployer`:

[source,yaml]
.config/database.yml
----
[...]

production:
  <<: *default
  database: blog_production
  username: deployer
  password: <%= ENV['BLOG_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
----

[[rake-dbmigration]]
=== rails db:migrate

We still need to create the production database tables:

[source,bash]
----
deployer@debian:~/blog$ rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production BLOG_DATABASE_PASSWORD=123456
[...]
deployer@debian:~/blog$
----

WARNING: You probably want to set `BLOG_DATABASE_PASSWORD` as an environment
         variable in your `.bash_profile` because it is not a good idea
         to have the DB password in your bash history.

[[rake-assetsprecompile]]
=== rails assets:precompile

`rails assets:precompile` ensures that all assets in the asset pipeline
are made available for the production environment.

[source,bash]
----
deployer@debian:~/blog$ rails assets:precompile
----

=== Puma pid

Puma needs the `tmp/puma` directory to store a pid file:

[source,bash]
----
deployer@debian:~/blog$ mkdir tmp/puma
deployer@debian:~/blog$ exit
logout
root@debian:~#
----

[[puma-init-script]]
=== Puma Init Script

The Puma web server has to be started automatically at every booting
process. Plus it has to be killed when the server shuts down. That's
been taken care of by an init script.

Please do the following commands as `root`.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd /etc/init.d
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puma/puma/master/tools/jungle/init.d/puma
$ chmod a+x puma
$ cd /usr/local/bin
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puma/puma/master/tools/jungle/init.d/run-puma
$ chmod a+x run-puma
$ touch /etc/puma.conf
$ chmod 640 /etc/puma.conf
$ update-rc.d -f puma defaults
----

Now we have to create the configuration for the production instance.
It includes the environment variables `BLOG_DATABASE_PASSWORD` and
`SECRET_KEY_BASE`.

TIP: To create a new `SECRET_KEY_BASE` you should run `rails secret` in your
     rails project directory.

[source,config]
./etc/puma.conf
----
/home/deployer/blog,deployer,/home/deployer/blog/config/puma.rb,/home/deployer/blog/log/production.log,RAILS_ENV=production;PORT=3001;BLOG_DATABASE_PASSWORD=123456;SECRET_KEY_BASE=AASD...ASDF
----

TIP: If you don't want to store the environment variables in `/etc/puma.conf`
     you can use the `bin/rails secrets:setup` mechanism.

It's time to start puma:

[source,bash]
----
$ /etc/init.d/puma start
[ ok ] Starting puma (via systemctl): puma.service.
$
----

Now puma runs and is available at `http://localhost:3001`. To make it
available to the internet we have to setup nginx.

[[nginx-configuration]]
=== nginx Configuration

For the Rails project, we add a new configuration file
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/blog.conf` with the following content:

[source,config]
./etc/nginx/sites-available/blog.conf
----
server {
  listen 80 default deferred;
  # server_name example.com;

  root /home/deployer/blog/public;

  location / {
    gzip_static on;
    try_files $uri/index.html $uri @puma;
  }

  location ^~ /assets/ {
    gzip_static on;
    expires max;
    add_header Cache-Control public;
  }

  location @puma {
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
  }

  error_page 500 502 503 504 /500.html;
  client_max_body_size 4G;
  keepalive_timeout 10;
}
----

We link this configuration file into the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`
directory to have it loaded by Nginx. The default file can be deleted.
After that we restart Nginx and are all set. You can access the Rails
application through the IP address of this server.

[source,bash]
----
$ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/blog.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
$ rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
$ /etc/init.d/nginx restart
[ ok ] Restarting nginx (via systemctl): nginx.service.
$
----

You're all set. Your new Rails project is online. You can access the `posts`.
You'll have to configure the `root` path in `config/routes.rb` to get a proper
root path URL.

[[loading-updated-versions-of-the-rails-project]]
=== Loading Updated Versions of the Rails Project

If you want to activate Updates to the Rails project, you need to copy
them into the directory `/home/deployer/blog` and log in as user
`deployer` to run `rails assets:precompile` (see
xref:asset-pipeline["Asset Pipeline"]).

[source,bash]
----
deployer@debian:~/blog$ rails assets:precompile
[...]
deployer@debian:~/blog$
----

If you bring in new migrations, you of course also need to do a
`rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production`:

[source,bash]
----
deployer@debian:~/blog$ rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
[...]
deployer@debian:~/blog$
----

Then you need to restart Puma as user `root`:

[source,bash]
----
root@debian:~# /etc/init.d/puma restart
----

=== Performance

If performance is key for your production webserver you want to use a socket
connection instead of the TCP connection.

[[misc]]
== Misc

[[alternative-setups]]
=== Alternative Setups

The RVM, Puma and Nginx way is fast and makes it possible to setup
different Ruby versions on one server. But many admins prefer an easier
installation process which is promised by Phusion Passenger. Have a look
at https://www.phusionpassenger.com for more information about
Passenger. It is a very good and reliable solution.

[[what-else-there-is-to-do]]
=== What Else There Is To Do

Please always consider the following points - every admin has to decide
these for him- or herself and implement them accordingly:

* Automatic and regular backup of database and Rails project.
* Set up log rotations of log files.
* Set up monitoring for system load and hard drive space.
* Regularly install Debian security updates as soon as they become
available.

[[and-co.]]
=== 404 and Co.

Finally, please look into the `public` directory in your Rails project
and adapt the HTML pages saved there to your own requirements.
Primarily, this is about the design of the pages. In the default
setting, these are somewhat sparse and do not have any relation to the
rest of your website. If you decide to update your web page and shut
down your Puma server to do so, nginx will deliver the web page
`public/500.html` in the meantime.

You will find a list of HTTP error codes at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

[[multiple-rails-servers-on-one-system]]
=== Multiple Rails Servers on One System

You can runs several Rails servers on one system without any problems.
You need to set up a separate Puma for each Rails server. You can
then distribute to it from nginx. With nginx you can also define on
which IP address a Rails server is accessible from the outside.

[[cloud-platform-as-service-provider]]
== Cloud Platform as Service Provider

If you do not have a web server available on the internet or want to
deploy to a PaaS (Platform as a Service) system right from the start,
you should have a look at what the various providers have to offer. The
two US market leaders are currently Heroku (http://www.heroku.com/) and
Engine Yard (http://www.engineyard.com/).

PaaS as platform usually offers less options than your own server. But
you have 7x24 support for this platform if anything does not work
properly.
