= Action Cable

Most modern webpages are not just static. They often get updates from
the server without interaction from the user. Your Twitter or GMail
browser client will display new Tweets or E-Mails without you reloading
the page. The server pushes the information. Action Cable provides the
tools you need to use these mechanisms without diving deep into the
technical aspects of websockets.

The use of Action Cable always includes JavaScript and this book is
about Ruby and Ruby on Rails. So I will only show you a minimal
Hello World example of how Action Cable works.

== Hello World ActionCable Example

In our first example we are going to push content from the Rails console
into a browser which shows the `page#index` view.

=== The Rails Application

Please create the following Rails application:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new hello-world-action-cable
  [...]
$ cd hello-world-action-cable
$ rails generate controller page index
  [...]
----

A root route so that we can access the page at
http://localhost:3000

[source,ruby]
.config/routes.rb
----
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'page/index'
  root 'page#index'
end
----

The content of the view:

[source,erb]
.app/views/page/index.html.erb
----
<h1>Action Cable Example</h1>

<div id="messages"></div>
----

=== Setting up jQuery

We are going to append HTML to `<div id="messages"></div>` in the DOM.
To do that we need https://jquery.com[jQuery] which is not installed by
default in Rails 5.1 any more. There are two ways of doing this.
The old way was to add `gem 'jquery-rails'` followed by a `bundle`. This
still works but Rails 5.1 has yarn build in and that is the new way of
tackle the . If you haven't installed yarn yet have a look at
https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

If you are using macOS and https://brew.sh[Homebrew] you can install
it via `brew install yarn`:

[source,bash]
----
brew install yarn
----

Within Rails 5.1 you can use yarn now to install jQuery:

[source,bash]
----
$ bin/yarn add jquery
yarn add v0.21.3

[4/4] 📃  Building fresh packages...
success Saved lockfile.
success Saved 1 new dependency.
└─ jquery@3.2.1
✨  Done in 1.57s.
----

To load 'jQuery' we have to add it in the
`app/assets/javascripts/application.js` file:

[source,javascript]
.app/assets/javascripts/application.js
----
//= require jquery
//= require rails-ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
----

=== Creating a Channel

Rails provides a handy generator to create a new channel.
We call our channel "WebNotifications".

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate channel WebNotifications
Running via Spring preloader in process 17653
      create  app/channels/web_notifications_channel.rb
   identical  app/assets/javascripts/cable.js
      create  app/assets/javascripts/channels/web_notifications.coffee
----

When ever somebody requests the `page#index` view we want him/her to
automatically subscribe to our the `WebNotificationsChannel` channel.
We do this by adding this piece of CoffeeScript:

[source,javascript]
.app/assets/javascripts/page.coffee
----
App.room = App.cable.subscriptions.create "WebNotificationsChannel",
  received: (data) ->
    $('#messages').append data['message']
----

Lastly we have to add this code to the channel.

[source,ruby]
.app/channels/web_notifications_channel.rb
----
class WebNotificationsChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_from "web_notifications_channel"
  end

  def unsubscribed
  end
end
----

We are going to start a `rails server` and a `rails console`
in separate terminals. We need to use the Redis gem to make
this work. This is not the default in the development setup.

We have to activate the Redis gem by including this line in
the 'Gemfile'

[source,ruby]
.Gemfile
----
gem 'redis', '~> 3.0'
----

After that change you have to run 'bundle' once more:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle
----

TIP: If you are running macOS and `brew` you can install
     Redis with `brew install redis` and start it with
     `brew services start redis`.

And we have to configure the use of Redis:

[source,yaml]
.config/cable.yml
----
redis: &redis
  adapter: redis
  url: redis://localhost:6379/1

production: *redis
development: *redis
test: *redis
----

Finally it's time to start up our development rails server:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails server
----

And load http://localhost:3000 in your webbrowser. In the
log you'll see this entry:

[source,log]
----
Finished "/cable/" [WebSocket] for 127.0.0.1 at 2017-03-30 08:33:41 +0200
WebNotificationsChannel stopped streaming from web_notifications_channel
Started GET "/cable" for 127.0.0.1 at 2017-03-30 08:33:41 +0200
Started GET "/cable/" [WebSocket] for 127.0.0.1 at 2017-03-30 08:33:41 +0200
Successfully upgraded to WebSocket (REQUEST_METHOD: GET,
HTTP_CONNECTION: Upgrade, HTTP_UPGRADE: websocket)
WebNotificationsChannel is transmitting the subscription confirmation
WebNotificationsChannel is streaming from web_notifications_channel
----

Now start a new terminal and go to the directory where your
Rails project is locate. Fire up the console and use
`ActionCable.server.broadcast` to broadcast a message to
`web_notifications_channel`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 19706
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.0)
>> ActionCable.server.broadcast 'web_notifications_channel',
message: '<p>Hello World!</p>'
[ActionCable] Broadcasting to web_notifications_channel:
{:message=>"<p>Hello World!</p>"}
=> 1
----

Now you can see the update in your browser window.

image::screenshots/chapter-action-cable/hello-world.png[hello world example]

You can add other messages by calling
`ActionCable.server.broadcast 'web_notifications_channel',
message: '<p>Hello World!</p>'` again.

Congratulation! You have your first working Action Cable application.

TIP: By using `$('#messages').replaceWith data['message']` in
     `app/assets/javascripts/page.coffee` you can replace the HTML content
     instead of appending it. See http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
