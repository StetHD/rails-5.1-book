= Scaffolding and REST

[[scaffolding-introduction]]
== Introduction

Scaffolding means purely and simply that a basic _scaffold_ for an
application is created with a generator. This scaffold not only contains
the _model_ but also a simple Web GUI (_views_) and of course a
_controller_. The programming paradigm used for this is REST
(Representational State Transfer).

You can find a definition of REST at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer]. My super
short version: the inventor Roy Fielding described in 2000 how you can
access data with a simple set of rules within the concept of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete[CRUD] and the
specification of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). CRUD is the
abbreviation for Create (SQL: INSERT), Read (SQL: SELECT), Update (SQL:
UPDATE) and Delete (SQL: Delete). This created URLs that are easy to
read for humans and have a certain logic. In this chapter, you will see
examples showing the individual paths for the different CRUD functions.

I think the greatest frustration with Rails arises regularly from the
fact that many beginners use scaffolding to get quick results without
having proper basic knowledge of Ruby and without knowing what
ActiveRecord is. They don’t know what to do next. Fortunately, you have
worked your way through the chapters xref:ruby-basics["Ruby
Basics"], xref:first-steps-with-rails["First
Steps with Rails"] and xref:activerecord["ActiveRecord"], so you will be
able to understand and use scaffolding straight away.

== Redirects and Flash Messages

Scaffolding uses redirects and flash messages. So we have to make a
little detour first to understand scaffolding.

[[redirects]]
=== Redirects

The name says it all, really: _redirects_ are commands that you can use
within the controller to skip, i.e. redirect, to other web pages.

NOTE: A redirect returns to the browser the response `302 Moved`
      with the new target. So each redirect does a roundtrip to
      the browser and back.

Let's create a new Rails project for a suitable example:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new redirect_example
[...]
$ cd redirect_example
----

Before we can redirect, we need a controller with at least two different
methods. Off we go with a ping pong example:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate controller Game ping pong
Running via Spring preloader in process 51759
      create  app/controllers/game_controller.rb
       route  get 'game/pong'
       route  get 'game/ping'
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/game
      create    app/views/game/ping.html.erb
      create    app/views/game/pong.html.erb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/controllers/game_controller_test.rb
      invoke  helper
      create    app/helpers/game_helper.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      invoke  assets
      invoke    coffee
      create      app/assets/javascripts/game.coffee
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/game.scss
----

The controller `app/controllers/game_controller.rb` has the following
content:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/game_controller.rb
----
class GameController < ApplicationController
  def ping
  end

  def pong
  end
end
----

Now for the redirect: how can we achieve that we get immediately
redirected to the method pong when we go to
http://localhost:3000/game/ping? Easy, you will say, we just change the
route in `config/routes.rb`. And you are right. So we don't necessarily
need a redirect. But if we want to process something else in the method
ping before redirecting, then this is only possible by using a
`redirect_to` in the controller `app/controllers/game_controller.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/game_controller.rb
----
class GameController < ApplicationController
  def ping
   logger.info '+++  Example  +++'
   redirect_to game_pong_path
  end

  def pong
  end
end
----

But what is `game_pong_path`? Let's have a look a the routes generated
for this Rails application:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails routes
   Prefix Verb URI Pattern          Controller#Action
game_ping GET  /game/ping(.:format) game#ping
game_pong GET  /game/pong(.:format) game#pong
----

[NOTE]
====
As you can see, the route to the _action_ `ping` of the
controller `GameController` now gets the name `game_ping`
(see beginning of the line). We could also write the
redirect like this:

[source,ruby]
----
redirect_to :action => 'pong'
----
====

I will explain the details and the individual options of the redirect
later in the context of each specific case. For now, you just need to
know that you can redirect not just to another method, but also to
another controller or an entirely different web page.

When we try to go to http://localhost:3000/game/ping we are
automatically redirected to http://localhost:3000/game/pong and in the
log output we see this:

[source,bash]
----
Started GET "/game/ping" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-04-15 17:50:04 +0200
Processing by GameController#ping as HTML
+++  Example  +++
Redirected to http://localhost:3000/game/pong
Completed 302 Found in 14ms (ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)


Started GET "/game/pong" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-04-15 17:50:04 +0200
Processing by GameController#pong as HTML
  Rendered game/pong.html.erb within layouts/application (2.1ms)
Completed 200 OK in 2128ms (Views: 2127.4ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
----

[[redirect_to-back]]
=== redirect_to :back

If you want to redirect the user of your web application to the page he
has just been you can use `redirect_to :back`. This is very useful in a
scenario where your user first has to login to get access to a specific
page.

[[flash-messages]]
=== Flash Messages

In my eyes, the term “_flash messages_” is somewhat misleading. Almost
anyone would associate the term “_Flash_” with more or less colorful web
pages that were implemented with the Adobe Shockwave Flash Plug-in. But
in Ruby on Rails, flash messages are something completely different.
They are messages that are displayed, for example on the new page after
a redirect (see xref:redirects[section Redirects]).

Flash messages are good friends with redirects. The two often work
together in a team to give the user feedback on an action he just
carried out. A typical example of a flash message is the system feedback
when a user has logged in. Often the user is redirected back to the
original page and gets the message “You are now logged in.”

As an example, we are once more constructing the ping pong scenario from
xref:redirects[section "Redirects"]:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new pingpong
      [...]
$ cd pingpong
$ rails generate controller Game ping pong
      [...]
----

We fill the `app/controllers/game_controller.rb` with the following
content:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/game_controller.rb
----
class GameController < ApplicationController
  def ping
   redirect_to game_pong_path, notice: 'Ping-Pong!'
  end

  def pong
  end
end
----

Now we start the Rails web server with `rails server` and use the
browser to go to http://localhost:3000/game/ping. We are redirected from
ping to pong. But the flash message "Ping-Pong!" is nowhere to be seen.
We first need to expand `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

[source,erb]
.app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>RedirectExample</title>
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
  </head>

  <body>
    <% flash.each do |name, message| %>
      <p><i><%= "#{name}: #{message}" %></i></p>
    <% end %>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
----

Now we see the flash message at the top of the page when we go to
http://localhost:3000/game/ping in the browser:

image::screenshots/chapter03/flash_pong_notice.png[flash pong notice]

If we go to http://localhost:3000/game/pong we still see the normal Pong
page. But if we go to http://localhost:3000/game/ping we are redirected
to the Pong page and then the flash message is displayed at the top.

TIP: If you do not see a flash message that you were expecting,
     first check in the view to see if the flash message is output
     there.

[[different-types-of-flash-message]]
=== Different Types of Flash Message

Flash messages are automagically passed to the view in a hash. By
default, there are three different types: `error`, `warning` and
`notice`. You can also invent your own category and then get it in the
view later.

You can set a flash message by writing the hash directly too:

[source,ruby]
flash[:notice] = 'Ping-Pong!'

Please have a look at the official documentation at
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#the-flash
for more information.

[[why-are-there-flash-messages-at-all]]
=== Why Are There Flash Messages At All?

You may wonder why there are flash messages in the first place. Couldn't
you just build them yourself if you need them? Yes, indeed. But flash
messages have the advantage that they offer a defined approach that is
the same for any programmer. So you don't need to start from scratch
every single time you need one.


[[generating-a-scaffold]]
== Generating a Scaffold

Let’s first use scaffolding to create a list of products for an online
shop. First, we need to create a new Rails application:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new scaffold-shop
  [...]
$ cd scaffold-shop
----

Let’s look at the scaffolding options:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate scaffold
Usage:
  rails generate scaffold NAME [field[:type][:index] field[:type][:index]]
  [options]

[...]

Examples:
    `rails generate scaffold post`
    `rails generate scaffold post title body:text published:boolean`
    `rails generate scaffold purchase amount:decimal tracking_id:integer:uniq`
    `rails generate scaffold user email:uniq password:digest`
----

I’ll keep it short: for our current state of knowledge, we can use
`rails generate scaffold` just like `rails generate model`. Let’s create
the scaffold for the products:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate scaffold product name 'price:decimal{7,2}'
Running via Spring preloader in process 52261
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20170323161553_create_products.rb
      create    app/models/product.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/product_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/products.yml
      invoke  resource_route
       route    resources :products
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/products_controller.rb
      invoke    erb
      create      app/views/products
      create      app/views/products/index.html.erb
      create      app/views/products/edit.html.erb
      create      app/views/products/show.html.erb
      create      app/views/products/new.html.erb
      create      app/views/products/_form.html.erb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/controllers/products_controller_test.rb
      invoke    helper
      create      app/helpers/products_helper.rb
      invoke      test_unit
      invoke    jbuilder
      create      app/views/products/index.json.jbuilder
      create      app/views/products/show.json.jbuilder
      create      app/views/products/_product.json.jbuilder
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/system/products_test.rb
      invoke  assets
      invoke    coffee
      create      app/assets/javascripts/products.coffee
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/products.scss
      invoke  scss
      create    app/assets/stylesheets/scaffolds.scss
----

As you can see, `rails generate scaffold` has already created the model.
So we can directly call `rails db:migrate`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:migrate
== 20151218150127 CreateProducts: migrating ===================================
-- create_table(:products)
   -> 0.0023s
== 20151218150127 CreateProducts: migrated (0.0024s) ==========================
----

Let’s create the first six products in the `db/seeds.rb`.

[source,ruby]
----
Product.create(name: 'Apple', price: 1)
Product.create(name: 'Orange', price: 1)
Product.create(name: 'Pineapple', price: 2.4)
Product.create(name: 'Marble cake', price: 3)
----

Populate with the example data:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:seed
----

[[the-routes]]
=== The Routes

`rails generate scaffold` has created a route (more on this later in
the chapter xref:routes["Routes"]), a controller and several views for us.

We could also have done all of this manually. Scaffolding is merely an
automatism that does the work for us for some basic things. This is
assuming that you always want to view, create and delete records.

Without diving too deeply into the topic routes, let’s just have a quick
look at the available routes for our example. You need to run
`rails routes`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails routes
      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action
    products GET    /products(.:format)          products#index
             POST   /products(.:format)          products#create
 new_product GET    /products/new(.:format)      products#new
edit_product GET    /products/:id/edit(.:format) products#edit
     product GET    /products/:id(.:format)      products#show
             PATCH  /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
             PUT    /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
             DELETE /products/:id(.:format)      products#destroy
----

These are all the routes and consequently URLs available in this Rails
application. All routes invoke actions (in other words, methods) in the
`ProductsController`.

[[the-controller]]
=== The Controller

Now it’s about time we had a look at the file
`app/controllers/products_controller.rb`. Scaffold automatically creates
the methods index, show, new, create, update and destroy. These methods
or actions are called by the routes.

Here is the content of `app/controllers/products_controller.rb`

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/products_controller.rb
----
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_product, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]

  # GET /products
  # GET /products.json
  def index
    @products = Product.all
  end

  # GET /products/1
  # GET /products/1.json
  def show
  end

  # GET /products/new
  def new
    @product = Product.new
  end

  # GET /products/1/edit
  def edit
  end

  # POST /products
  # POST /products.json
  def create
    @product = Product.new(product_params)

    respond_to do |format|
      if @product.save
        format.html { redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product was successfully created.' }
        format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @product }
      else
        format.html { render :new }
        format.json { render json: @product.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
      end
    end
  end

  # PATCH/PUT /products/1
  # PATCH/PUT /products/1.json
  def update
    respond_to do |format|
      if @product.update(product_params)
        format.html { redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product was successfully updated.' }
        format.json { render :show, status: :ok, location: @product }
      else
        format.html { render :edit }
        format.json { render json: @product.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
      end
    end
  end

  # DELETE /products/1
  # DELETE /products/1.json
  def destroy
    @product.destroy
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html { redirect_to products_url, notice: 'Product was successfully destroyed.' }
      format.json { head :no_content }
    end
  end

  private
    # Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.
    def set_product
      @product = Product.find(params[:id])
    end

    # Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through.
    def product_params
      params.require(:product).permit(:name, :price)
    end
end
----

Let us take a moment and go through this controller.

[[set_product]]
==== set_product

A `before_action` calls a private method to set an instance variable
`@product` for the actions :show, :edit, :update and :destroy. That DRYs
it up nicely:

[source,ruby]
----
before_action :set_product, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]

[...]

private
  # Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.
  def set_product
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  end
[...]
----

[[index]]
==== index

The `index` method sets the instance variable `@products`. It contains
the result of `Product.all`.

[source,ruby]
----
# GET /products
# GET /products.json
def index
  @products = Product.all
end
----

[[show]]
==== show

The `show` method doesn’t do anything. `set_product` `before_action`
already set the instance variable `@product`. So there is not more to
do.

[source,ruby]
----
# GET /products/1
# GET /products/1.json
def show
end
----

[[new]]
new
+++

The `new` method creates a new instance of Product and saves it in the
instance variable `@product`.

[source,ruby]
----
# GET /products/new
def new
  @product = Product.new
end
----

[[edit]]
==== edit

The `edit` method doesn’t do anything. the `set_product` `before_action`
already set the instance variable `@product`. So there is not more to
do.

[source,ruby]
----
# GET /products/1/edit
def edit
end
----

[[create]]
==== create

The `create` method uses `Product.new` to create a new instance of
Product and stores it in `@product`. The private method `product_params`
is used to filter the trusted parameters with a white list. When
`@product` was successfully saved a `redirect` to the `show` action is
initiated for html requests. If a validation error occurred the `new`
action will be rendered.

[source,ruby]
----
# POST /products
# POST /products.json
def create
  @product = Product.new(product_params)

  respond_to do |format|
    if @product.save
      format.html { redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product was successfully created.' }
      format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @product }
    else
      format.html { render :new }
      format.json { render json: @product.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end

[...]

# Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through.
def product_params
  params.require(:product).permit(:name, :price)
end
----

[[update]]
==== update

The `update` method tries to update @product with the `product_params`.
The private method `product_params` is used to filter the trusted
parameters with a white list. When `@product` was successfully updated a
`redirect` to the `show` action is initiated for html requests. If a
validation error occured the `edit` action will be rendered.

[source,ruby]
----
# PATCH/PUT /products/1
# PATCH/PUT /products/1.json
def update
  respond_to do |format|
    if @product.update(product_params)
      format.html { redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product was successfully updated.' }
      format.json { render :show, status: :ok, location: @product }
    else
      format.html { render :edit }
      format.json { render json: @product.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end

[...]

# Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through.
def product_params
  params.require(:product).permit(:name, :price)
end
----

[[destroy]]
==== destroy

The `destroy` method destroys `@product` and redirects an html request
to the `index` action.

[source,ruby]
----
# DELETE /products/1
# DELETE /products/1.json
def destroy
  @product.destroy
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html { redirect_to products_url, notice: 'Product was successfully destroyed.' }
    format.json { head :no_content }
  end
end
----

[[the-views]]
=== The Views

Now we start the Rails web server:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.1.0.rc1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 3.8.2 (ruby 2.4.0-p0), codename: Sassy Salamander
* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
----

Now a little drum roll ... dramatic suspense ... launch the web browser and go
to the URL http://localhost:3000/products. You can see the list of
products as simple web page.

image::screenshots/chapter05/products_index.png[products index,title="Products index"]

If you now click the link _New Product_, you will see an input form
for a new record:

image::screenshots/chapter05/product_new.png[product new,title="Products new"]

Use your browser’s Back button to go back and click on the _Show_ link
in the first line. You will then see the following page:

image::screenshots/chapter05/product_show_1.png[product show,title="Products show"]

If you now click _Edit_, you will see the editing view for this
record:

image::screenshots/chapter05/product_edit_1.png[product edit,title="Products edit"]

And if you click _Destroy_ on the Index page, you can delete a record
after confirming the message that pops up. Isn’t that cool?! Within less
than 10 minutes, you have written a Web application that allows you to
*c*reate, *r*ead/*r*etrieve, *u*pdate and *d*elete/*d*estroy records
CRUD. That is the scaffolding magic. You can save a lot of time.

[[where-are-the-views]]
==== Where Are the Views?

You can probably guess, but let’s have a look at the directory
`app/views/products` anyway:

[source,bash]
----
$ tree app/views/products/
app/views/products/
├── _form.html.erb
├── _product.json.jbuilder
├── edit.html.erb
├── index.html.erb
├── index.json.jbuilder
├── new.html.erb
├── show.html.erb
└── show.json.jbuilder
----

There are two different file extensions. The `html.erb` is for HTML
requests and the `json.jbuilder` is for JSON requests.

For `index`, `edit`, `new` and `show` the corresponding views are
located there. As `new` and `edit` both require a form for editing the
data, this is stored in the partial `_form.html.erb` in accordance with
the principle of DRY (*D*on’t *R*epeat
*Y*ourself) and integrated in `new.html.erb` and `edit.html.erb` with a
`<%= render 'form' %>`.

Let’s open the file `app/views/products/index.html.erb`:

[source,erb]
.app/views/products/index.html.erb
----
<p id="notice"><%= notice %></p>

<h1>Products</h1>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @products.each do |product| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= product.name %></td>
        <td><%= product.price %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Show', product %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_product_path(product) %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', product, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

<%= link_to 'New Product', new_product_path %>
----

You are now an old hand when it comes to ERB, so you’ll be able to read
and understand the code without any problems.

[[link_to]]
==== link_to

In the views generated by the scaffold generator, you first came across
the helper `link_to`. This creates `<a hre ...>` links. You can of
course also enter a link manually via `<a href="...">` in the erb, but
for links within a Rails project, `link_to` is more practical, because
you can use the names of the routes as a target. The code becomes much
easier to read. In the above example, there are the following routes:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails routes
      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action
    products GET    /products(.:format)          products#index
             POST   /products(.:format)          products#create
 new_product GET    /products/new(.:format)      products#new
edit_product GET    /products/:id/edit(.:format) products#edit
     product GET    /products/:id(.:format)      products#show
             PATCH  /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
             PUT    /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
             DELETE /products/:id(.:format)      products#destroy
----

The first part of this route is the name of the route. With a new call,
this is `new_product`. A link to `new_product` looks like this in the
erb code (you can see it at the end of the file
`app/views/products/index.html.erb`):

[source,erb]
----
<%= link_to 'New Product', new_product_path %>
----

In the HTML code of the generated page (http://localhost:3000/products)
you can see the result:

[source,erb]
----
<%= link_to 'New Product', new_product_path %>
----

With `link_to` you can also link to resources within a RESTful resource.
Again, you can find examples for this in
`app/views/products/index.html.erb`. In the table, a `show`, an `edit`
and a `destroy` link is rendered for each `product`:

[source,erb]
----
<tbody>
  <% @products.each do |product| %>
    <tr>
      <td><%= product.name %></td>
      <td><%= product.price %></td>
      <td><%= link_to 'Show', product %></td>
      <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_product_path(product) %></td>
      <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', product, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %></td>
    </tr>
  <% end %>
</tbody>
----

From the resource and the selected route, Rails automatically determines
the required URL and the required HTTP verb (in other words, whether it
is a POST, GET, PUT or DELETE). For index and show calls, you need to
observe the difference between singular and plural.
`link_to 'Show', product` links to a single record and
`link_to 'Show', products_path` links to the index view.

Whether the name of the route is used with or without the suffix `_path`
in `link_to` depends on whether Rails can ``derive'' the route from the
other specified information. If only one object is specified (in our
example, the variable `product`), then Rails automatically assumes that
it is a show route.

Examples:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|ERD-Code |Explanation
|`link_to 'Show', Product.first` |Link to the first product.

|`link_to 'New Product', new_product_path` |Link to the Web interface
where a new product can be created.

|`link_to 'Edit', edit_product_path(Product.first)` |Link to the form
where the first product can be edited.

|`link_to 'Destroy', Product.first, method: :delete` |Link to deleting
the first product.
|=======================================================================

[[form_for]]
==== form_for

In the partial used by `new` and `edit`,
`app/views/products/_form.html.erb`, you will find the following code
for the product form:

[source,erb]
.app/views/products/_form.html.erb
----
<%= form_with(model: product, local: true) do |f| %>
  <% if product.errors.any? %>
    <div id="error_explanation">
      <h2><%= pluralize(product.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this product from being saved:</h2>

      <ul>
      <% product.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
        <li><%= message %></li>
      <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <% end %>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :name %>
    <%= f.text_field :name %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :price %>
    <%= f.text_field :price %>
  </div>

  <div class="actions">
    <%= f.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
----

In a block, the helper `form_for` takes care of creating the HTML form
via which the user can enter the data for the record or edit it. If you
delete a complete `<div class="field">` element here, this can no longer
be used for input in the web interface. I am not going to comment on all
possible form field variations at this point. The most frequently used
ones will appear in examples later on and be explained then (if they are
not self-explanatory).

NOTE: You can find an overview of all form helpers at
      http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html

When using validations in the model, any validation errors that occur
are displayed in the following code at the head of the form:

[source,erb]
----
<% if product.errors.any? %>
  <div id="error_explanation">
    <h2><%= pluralize(product.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this product from being saved:</h2>

    <ul>
    <% product.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
      <li><%= message %></li>
    <% end %>
    </ul>
  </div>
<% end %>
----

Let’s add a small validation to the `app/models/product.rb` model:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name,
            presence: true
end
----

When ever somebody wants to save a product which doesn’t have a name
Rails will show this Flash Error:

image::screenshots/chapter05/product_error_flash.png[product error flash,title="Products error flash"]

[[access-via-json]]
==== Access via JSON

By default, Rails’ scaffolding generates not just access via HTML for
human users, but also a direct interface for machines. The same methods
`index`, `show`, `new`, `create`, `update` and `destroy` can be called
via this interface, but in a format that is easier to read for machines.
As an example, we will demonstrate the `index` action via which all data
can be read in one go. With the same idea, data can be removed
(`destroy`) or edited (`update`).

JSON (see
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation[wikipedia.org/wiki/Json])
seems to be the new cool kid. So we use JSON.

If you do not require machine-readable access to data, you can remove
these lines in the file `Gemfile` (followed by the command `bundle`).

[source,ruby]
.Gemfile
----
# Build JSON APIs with ease. Read more: https://github.com/rails/jbuilder
gem 'jbuilder', '~> 2.5'
----

Of course you can delete the `format.json` lines manually too. But
please don’t forget to delete the JSON view files too.

[[json-as-default]]
JSON as Default

Right at the beginning of `app/controllers/products_controller.rb` you
will find the entry for the index action:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/products_controller.rb
----
# GET /products
# GET /products.json
def index
  @products = Product.all
end
----

The code is straightforward. In the instance variable `@products`, all
products are saved. The view `app/views/products/index.json.jbuilder`
contains the following code to render the JSON:

[source,ruby]
.app/views/products/index.json.jbuilder
----
json.array! @products, partial: 'products/product', as: :product
----

It renders the partial _product.json.jbuilder:

[source,ruby]
.app/views/products/_product.json.jbuilder
----
json.extract! product, :id, :name, :price, :created_at, :updated_at
json.url product_url(product, format: :json)
----

You can use your browser to fetch the JSON output. Just open
http://localhost:3000/products.json and view the result. I installed a
JSON view extension in my Chrome browser to get a nicer format.

image::screenshots/chapter05/products_index_json.png[products index json,title="Products index json"]

If you do not want the JSON output, you need to delete the
`json.jbuilder` files.

[[json-and-xml-together]]
JSON and XML Together

If you ever need a JSON and XML interface in a Rails application, you
just need to specify both variants in the controller in the block
`respond_to`. Here is an example with the
`app/controllers/products_controller.rb` in the `index` action:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/products_controller.rb
----
# GET /products
# GET /products.json
# GET /products.xml
def index
  @products = product.all

  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # index.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @products }
    format.xml { render xml: @products }
  end
end
----

[[when-should-you-use-scaffolding]]
== When Should You Use Scaffolding?

You should never use scaffolding just for the sake of it. There are
Rails developers who never use scaffolding and always build everything
manually. I find scaffolding quite useful for quickly getting into a new
project. But it is always just the beginning.

[[example-for-a-minimal-project]]
=== Example for a Minimal Project

Let’s assume we need a web page quickly with which we can list products
and represent them individually. But we do not require an editing or
deleting function. In that case, a large part of the code created via
scaffold would be useless and have to be deleted. Let’s try it out as
follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new read-only-shop
  [...]
$ cd read-only-shop
$ rails generate scaffold product name 'price:decimal{7,2}'
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
----

Now create the `db/seeds.rb` with some demo products:

[source,ruby]
.db/seeds.rb
----
Product.create(name: 'Apple', price: 1)
Product.create(name: 'Orange', price: 1)
Product.create(name: 'Pineapple', price: 2.4)
Product.create(name: 'Marble cake', price: 3)
----

And populate it with this data:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:seed
----

As we only need `index` and `show`, we should delete the not required
views:

[source,bash]
----
$ rm app/views/products/_form.html.erb
$ rm app/views/products/new.html.erb
$ rm app/views/products/edit.html.erb
----

The `json.jbuilder` views are not needed either:

[source,bash]
----
$ rm app/views/products/*.json.jbuilder
----

The file `app/controllers/products_controller.rb` can be simplified with
an editor. It should look like this:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/products_controller.rb
----
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_product, only: [:show]

  # GET /products
  # GET /products.json
  def index
    @products = Product.all
  end

  # GET /products/1
  # GET /products/1.json
  def show
  end

  private
    # Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.
    def set_product
      @product = Product.find(params[:id])
    end
end
----

We only need the routes for `index` and `show`. Please open the file
`config/routes.rb` and edit it as follows:

[source,ruby]
.config/routes.rb
----
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :products, only: [:index, :show]
end
----

A `rails routes` shows us that really only `index` and `show` are routed
now:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails routes
  Prefix Verb URI Pattern             Controller#Action
products GET  /products(.:format)     products#index
 product GET  /products/:id(.:format) products#show
----

If we now start the server `rails server` and go to the URL
http://localhost:3000/products, we get an error message.

image::screenshots/chapter05/products_routes_error.png[products index json,title="Products index json"]

The same message will be displayed in the log:

[source,bash]
----

----

The error message states that we call an undefined method
`edit_product_path` in the view `app/views/products/index.html.erb`. As
we only route `index` and `show` now, there are no more `edit`,
`destroy` or `new` methods any more. So we need to adapt the file
`app/views/products/index.html.erb` in the editor as follows:

[source,erb]
.app/views/products/index.html.erb
----
<h1>Products</h1>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @products.each do |product| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= product.name %></td>
        <td><%= product.price %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Show', product %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>
----

And while we are at it, we also edit the
`app/views/products/show.html.erb` accordingly:

[source,erb]
.app/views/products/show.html.erb
----
<p>
  <strong>Name:</strong>
  <%= @product.name %>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Price:</strong>
  <%= @product.price %>
</p>

<%= link_to 'Back', products_path %>
----

Now our application is finished. Start the Rails server with
`rails server` and open the URL http://localhost:3000/products in the
browser.

NOTE: In this example, I am not commenting on the required changes in the
      tests, as this is not an exercise for test driven development but meant
      to demonstrate a way of working with scaffolding. TDD developers will
      quickly be able to adapt the tests.

[[conclusion]]
=== Conclusion

Have a go and try it out. Try working with scaffolds one time and
without them the next. Then you will soon get a feel for whether it fits
into your working flow or not. I find that scaffolding makes my work
much easier for standard applications.
