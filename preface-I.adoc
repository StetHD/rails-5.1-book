= Preface

This is my fifth Ruby on Rails book. It's splitted into two parts.
The first part (the one you are reading now) covers all the basics.
It gives you the important groundwork to create a Rails application.
The second one dives into advance topics (e.g. TDD, I18n, Caching,
ActionCable).

I write for developers who learn best by following clean examples.
I don’t like the idea of coding one big single application throughout
a book but prefer smaller stand-alone code examples. Therefore you can
skip a couple of pages or even complete chapters without losing context.

Don’t let people fool you into believing that Ruby on Rails is easy to
learn. It is not! It's one of the best and most effective frameworks
to develop web applications but it is hard to understand in the
beginning. The worst mistake of all is to not learn Ruby before diving
into Ruby on Rails. To avoid it this book starts with the
xref:ruby-basics[basics of Ruby]. You will not become a Ruby guru after
reading it but you’ll understand the basic ideas and that is important.

Shameless plug: Please contact me by e-mail to stefan.wintermeyer@amooma.de
if you need Ruby on Rails consulting or training.

Have fun with Ruby on Rails!
